            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O great and ſovereigne to Man hath been the beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of indulgent Nature, as that ſhe hath not only beſtowed upon his ſoul, above thoſe of other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the high and ſingular Prerogative of immortality; but hath moreover imparted to him light whereby he might come unto the knowledge of it, and by that ſame knowledge be excited to make a diligent inquiry after the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that follow on it, and how alſo in this life he may make his beſt advantages and preparations for the next. Neither is this ſame Truth of immortality any new diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, but acknowledge of old by the Heatheniſh and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Nations; of which thing we in the Work enſuing are to give in a large evidence, by our producing the many teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of a full and frequent Senate of ancient Sages, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of revelation, had nothing but nature to inſtruct them in this ſame verity.</p>
            <p>Againſt theſe powerfull impulſives and clearer notions of truth the adverſe party hath nothing to oppoſe but mere ſurmiſes or ſuſpicions, ſuch, namely, as the Authour of the Book of Wiſedome out of their own mouths recordeth, ſaying, <hi>There hath not any one been known to have returned from below:</hi> Or elſe ſuch as <hi>Pliny</hi> doth imagine, who grafteth
<pb facs="tcp:114895:3"/>the opinion of immortality, not upon an innate, or naturall longing and appetite, as he ſhould have done; but, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, upon a falſe ambition and greedineſſe in man of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſing to be.: Or againe, as <hi>Lucian,</hi> who brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make good what he conceiveth, beſides down-right impiety, dreſſed up and ſet forth with facetious ſcoffes and deriſory jeſtings, wherewith nevertheleſſe ſundry ill-affected ſpirits and feebler underſtandings are eaſier perſwaded, then with ſolid arguments.</p>
            <p>The Chorus of <hi>Seneca</hi> afterwards alleadged, moved, as it may ſeeme, with no better or stronger arguments then theſe, is driven, as by a ſtorme, into dark and doubtfull cogitations touching the ſouls mortality; and ſo alſo is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chorus conſiſting of <hi>Mahumetan Alfaquies</hi> in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Tragedy of <hi>Muſtapha.</hi> By ſuch ſhadowes alſo as theſe a late Philoſopher was affrighted and before him ſome of the ancients ſo farre forth as to be made imagine, that even granting the ſoul ſhould ſurvive the body, yet that it would not thence follow it were perpetuall, but that, contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in tract of time it might decay, and vapour it ſelf at length to nothing, burning or waſting out it's own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance like a torch or candle; or, at leaſt, have a period of duration ſet it, connaturally to the principles of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beyond which it was not to paſſe, but at that term or point preſently and naturally to extinguiſh or return to nothing: of which vain phantaſy we are to conſider more hereafter.</p>
            <p>But, if ſuſpicions may come to be examined, we ſhall find that there be other ſort of them perſwading the ſouls mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, that ſeeme more hollow and deceitful then the former are; as namely, a depraved appetite, or an unbridled and untamed ſenſuality, that ſollicites perpetually to be ſatisfied, and is deſirous, without feare of future reckonings in the other world, to wallow for the preſent and tumble, like a ſwine, in the mire of dirty pleaſures, and to conceive ſome
<pb facs="tcp:114895:3"/>ſhadow of ſecurity for it, that ſo, with the old Epicureans, it might merrily ſay,
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Ede, bibe, lude, poſt mortem nulla voluptas.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Eate, and drink, and play thy fill,</l>
                  <l>There's after death nor good nor ill.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe theſe later perſwaders ſeem to be more rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and corrupt then the former, and of more dangerous conſequence. And thus we ſee that on either ſide there want not ſuſpicions, namely, as well for concluding of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality as of immortality, if we will be guided by them. But into this high Court of judicature, wherein cauſes ſo weighty and ſo grave as this are to be decided, ſuſpicions and dark imaginations will not be allowed for evidence, or be able to caſt the buſineſſe either way.</p>
            <p>To theſe other proofs which after I alleadge, I adde this one, which I have placed in the frontiſpiece of this Treatiſe, namely, theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Matth. 22.</hi> partly recited by him out of Exodus: <hi>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaak, and the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</hi> By force of which Text the Sadduces, who denied there ſurrection, were convinced, and not onely they, but this Authour alſo against whom we deale; for the place proves the ſoul's immortality, as well as the bodies reſurrection, Becauſe if God be the God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham after death, then muſt his body one day riſe againe, to the end that being reunited with the ſoul there might reſult an Abraham; again, if he be the God alſo of the living, then muſt his ſoul continue living without any intermiſſion from death; for, as without a body there is no Abraham, ſo without a ſoul there is no <hi>vivens,</hi> or thing endued with life. If you object, that it is ſufficient if it live then when the body is to riſe, though not before: I anſwer, that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted living neither is nor can be ſufficient, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:114895:4"/>then according to this ſame ſuppoſition the ſoul muſt have a revivall and refuſcitation, for the which we have no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant any where, and feign it we muſt not; or if we do, it will want weight and be rejected. It follows then, that the ſoul of man after the departure of it from the body muſt either alwayes live, or never; and ſo, by conſequence, ſeeing the ſoul muſt live once more, it muſt live alwayes, that is to ſay, not onely at the reſurrection, as this Authour feigneth, but continually from the time of the ſeparation to the time of the reunion, and ſo after everlaſtingly. And this is the concluſion was intended. And thus much touching the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Treatiſe following.</p>
            <p>Now touching the Adverſary. I am to let you know, that if the Readers had not deſerved much more regard then he, and beſides, if the matter had not required ſome elucidation, more then his objections did an anſwer, I had been wholly ſilent and ſpared all this labour I have taken.</p>
            <p>Peradventure it may ſeem to ſome that over and above an anſwer given to this erroneous Authour, the paines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in opening the cauſe of the ſoul's indeficiency, and alſo the tracing out the ſeverall paths which lead unto the places from whence arguments are to be raiſed for the proving of it, was therefore ſuper fluous, becauſe we all ſhall quickly try whether it be ſo or no, foraſmuch as our Pilgrimage in this life cannot be of any large extent, either in old or young. To theſe men I returne no other anſwer but this one, that if the ſoul be immort all, that then, indeed, we ſhall experience whether it be ſo or no; but if it be not, we, in that caſe, ſhall experience nothing: for though a man broad awake does feel himſelf to live, yet one either dead or in a dead-ſleep, feels nothing at all, and knows not what he is. But betting that paſſe, it cannot be denied but that the knowledge of a ſoul's being incorruptible must needs be in this life a great conſolation to any man, and eſpecially to ſuch as be in great
<pb facs="tcp:114895:4"/>adverſity; for by that Truth he learns he may out-live his ſorrows, and attein at length unto a wiſhed reſt. Beſides, by this doctrine he hath a caveat given for his good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour here, and that, for the ſatisfaction of any unreaſonable and inordinate deſire, he venture not on any thing in this life that may be a hinderance of his felicity in the next.</p>
            <p>It was not the Authours intention to enter here in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Work into any diſputes that were not for every En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh reader's underſtanding; but, contrary to his minde, he was forced to ſtray from that purpoſe ever now and then, for the ſatisfying of ſundry flying objections; to which condeſcenſion he was induced the eaſier, becauſe ſuch diſputes could not be a prejudice to any Reader, in regard that thoſe harder pieces might be paſſed over by him very eaſily, and that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all thoſe, there was enough wherewith to entertain him: whereas on the other ſide, all ſuch digreſſions could not come unwelcome to others whoſe underſtandings had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted &amp; exerciſed with ſpeculations of greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo both ſorts of Readers receive contentment, one ſort by the eaſy, the other both by the eaſy and the hard.</p>

This poor and ſorrowfull manner of defaillance muſt needs be, of all other, the moſt hatefull, not ſo much for the deadlineſſe and venome, as for the reproch which follows it; for by it a man loſeth not truth alone, but withall his reputation and eſteem; it being a judgement very ſlenderly armed that with a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114895:6"/>wooden dart can be pierced through. Experience verifies what I affirm; for of late a ſorry Animal, better then ſo I cannot call him, whoſe ſoul he himſelf thinks to be mortall, and whoſe learning and capacity is ſo ſmall, as if indeed it were ſo mean as he imagineth it to be; This ſorry Animal, having ſtept into the crowd of Scriblers in the defence of an old rotten hereſy, condemned and ſuffocated by conſent of the wiſe, almoſt at the hour of its birth, hath met with ſome other dull ſouls ſo unhappy as to be perſwaded by him, and to think as meanly of themſelves as the wiſeſt of all ages have done of beaſts, to the diſhonour and debaſing of their own kind; not elevating beaſts to the degree of reaſon, as ſometimes <hi>Plutarch, Sextus Empiricus,</hi> and ſome others have ſought to do, though vainly, and peradventure more for oſtentation and argumentation ſake, then in any earneſt; but contrariwiſe, reproachfully depreſſing man, even as low as brute beaſts, by aſcribing to them both a mortalitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, one called <hi>Volkelius,</hi> hath in our times blindly ſtumbled upon this ſame errour, teaching it expreſly, and alſo labouring to prove it, <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 25. out of which puddle it is not unlikely this Adverſary of ours did draw his unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome waters of peſtiferous doctrine, and went no further for them.</p>
               <p>Upon the conſideration of thoſe errours that have of late infected us and betrayed humane nature, I cannot think it a thing improbable, but that the infernall ſpirit which hath ſuggeſted them, and governed the hearts of men as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant planet, in theſe Northern Provinces of <hi>Europe,</hi> is that martiall Devil called, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 9.11. <hi>Abaddon,</hi> or <hi>Apollyon,</hi> that is to ſay, a Deſtroyer; for as much as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of all ſuch as have diſturbed our peace of late dayes, are generally for ruine and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>For firſt, what is the wealth and treaſure of man, but the dignity and value of his actions? of this he hath long ſince been plundered. His eyeſight whereby his ſteps were to be guided, was his knowledge; but this divers have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to extinguiſh by denying, with the old <hi>Academicks</hi> and late <hi>Socinians,</hi> that there is any certainty in it, and by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114895:7"/>becoming ſo witty as to know nothing. His regall ſceptte, I mean his naturall liberty, by the command of which the Empire of his little world was ſwaied, is wreſted out of his hands, and voiced to be wholly forfeited and not any longer to appertain unto him. His crown and life was the immortality of his better part, as therein chiefly being ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to beaſts and all other things irrationall; but behold here alſo a privy but a dangerous traitour endeavours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoil him of it; ſo that in fine, if all theſe treacherous aſſailants might have their wills, he ſhall be wholly mortall, poor, feeble, blind, and miſerable, dethroned from his wonted dignity, and caſt down unto the lower claſſe of Beaſts. <hi>Profectò plurima homini ex homine mala,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> juſtly complaineth, even though he himſelf be one of the Authours of thoſe evils which come from man againſt himſelf. Was it not enough that all inferiour creatures do rebell againſt us, but we muſt baſely and treacherouſly conſpire againſt our ſelves? The man that going from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to <hi>Jericho</hi> fell amongſt thieves, had hard meaſure offered him, for he was deſpoiled and wounded by them, and left onely half alive; but thoſe thieves amongſt whom we are now fallen be farre more cruell, for they would kill us outright, that is to ſay, both in ſoul and body, and with leſſe then this will not be contented. But now it is time we begin to examine what urgent reaſons, what killing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there were that moved this new Authour unto ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant a courſe of rigour againſt all mankind; for if theſe be not very urgent and invincible, we muſt conclude this man guilty not onely of much folly, but alſo of hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous malice and temerity againſt the rights and prerogatives of man, in defenſe of which we now come into the field againſt him.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>His firſt Claſſe of arguments examined and refuted.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HIs firſt arguments be drawn from mans creation, fall, reſtitution and reſurrection: the principall is this,</p>
               <p>That what of <hi>Adam</hi> was immortall through Innocency, was to be mortalized by tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>But whole <hi>Adam (quatenus animal rationale)</hi> was in Innocency immortall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> all and every part, even whole man liable to death by ſinne.</p>
               <p>Upon this bungling argument or ſyllogiſme the weight of all his cauſe muſt lean, which, as I perceive by the poſture, ſhould have been a ſyllogiſme, if the Authour could have caſt it into that form; but ſince that might not be, we will be contented to take it in groſſe as it lies, rather then paſſe it over without an anſwer. We grant then that indeed all <hi>Adam</hi> for example by ſinning became mortall, and all and every part of him; that is to ſay, he was after ſo much of his age exſpired, to yield up to death and be totally corrupted; or, which is all one, he was to have his two eſſentiall parts diſunited, and after that, untill the reſurrection, neither he, nor any of his parts thus diſſevered and diſunited, to be <hi>Adam,</hi> or a man any longer, All which might be without that either the matter of his body, or ſubſtance of his ſoul ſhould periſh or be deſtroyed, as <hi>Thomas de Argentina</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly teacheth in 2. <hi>diſt.</hi> 17. <hi>ar.</hi> 1. <hi>ad</hi> 1. <hi>arg.</hi> And foraſmuch as concerns the matter of his body, it is an evident caſe, becauſe matter is a thing both ingenerable and incorruptible, and ſo neither produced by his generation, nor deſtroyed by his corruption; and as by generation onely faſhioned and united, ſo again by corruption or death, onely defaced and diſunited or diſſolved. And as for the ſoul the other part, there is no more neceſſity death ſhould deſtroy it, then
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114895:8"/>there was it ſhould deſtroy the matter, there being no more reaſon for the one then for the other. Wherefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhing death that ſo he might be with Chriſt, did not deſire to be deſtroyed, as this ſilly Authours doctrine would infer, but to be diſſolved; for ſurely if his ſoul was to have been deſtroyed, by any naturall deficiency, or otherwiſe, he could not think to be with Chriſt, during the time of that deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or diſſolution which he wiſhed, and ſo his words and wiſhing would have been very vain, ſeeing, according to this Authour, he ſhould by his being diſſolved come never the ſooner to be with Chriſt; becauſe according to him, neither alive nor dead he was to come unto Chriſt before the generall reſurrection: nay further, his wiſh would have made againſt himſelf and his own ends, becauſe he knowing Chriſt a little in this life, might in ſome ſmall meaſure injoy him in it; but if by death his ſoul be killed as well as his body, he ſhould have no knowledge at all nor comfort of Chriſt, but be caſt further off from him then he was before.</p>
               <p>Now as all agree that matter throughout all mutations remaineth incorrupted; ſo alſo, according to the judgement of ſundry knowing men, and diligent inquirers into the works of nature and tranſmutation of naturall compounds, naturall and materiall forms themſelves alſo do not periſh at their parting from their matters, but onely are diſſolved and diſſipated, lying after that ſeparation in their ſcattered atomes within the boſome of nature, from whence they had been before extracted by force of the ſeed, the reſult of whoſe union was the form. So that the entity of the form remains ſtill unperiſhed after corruption, though not in the eſſence and formality of a form, or totally and compleatly. Thus teacheth the learned Authour of <hi>Religio Medici,</hi> and exactly declares himſelf: of the ſame mind is the famous late Phyſician <hi>Daniel Sennertus</hi> in his <hi>Hypomnemata,</hi> though ſometimes not ſo fully; as for example, when he aſcribes to forms precedent the full production of the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114895:8"/>aſſigning a genitall power, or <hi>vis prolifica</hi> in every form for multiplying of it ſelf: by which doctrine he ſeems to recede from his former principles of Atomes, and not to ſtick conſtantly to them, yea, and beſides to deliver a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit which is hardly underſtood, and which moreover ſeems to be improbable; for who can explicate what one form doth when it multiplies another, or what kind of cauſality it doth then exerciſe, or by what ſtrange influence that effect is wrought and the form made up of nothing? This ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Religio Medici,</hi> and that alſo which we deliver here touching the origination of forms, was the doctrine of old <hi>Democritus,</hi> expreſſed by him in his conſtitution of Atomes, or <hi>minima naturalia,</hi> as we find it largely expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and illuſtrated by <hi>Joan. Magnenus l. de Philoſophia Democriti 'Diſp.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; ſeqq.</hi> as alſo by <hi>Petrus Gaſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> in his voluminous work <hi>de Philoſophia Epicuri tomo</hi> 1. with whom in ſubſtance agreed <hi>Leucippus,</hi> as we may find by that which <hi>Laertius</hi> and others do deliver of him. Not that every Atome did contain a form, as <hi>Sennertus</hi> ſeems to think, but rather ſeverall pieces for the compoſition of it; according as every ſimple or ingredient of <hi>Diacatholicon,</hi> for example, is not <hi>Diacatholicon,</hi> but contains ſomething in it of which it is to be made up, and from which as from differing heterogeneall parcels, collected and united by an artificiall mixtion, it reſults; and for want of putting this difference or reſtraint, <hi>Sennertus</hi> his own doctrine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of <hi>Democritus</hi> may ſeem defective. But though we may approve of Phyſicall Atomes for the compoſition of naturall bodies, yet we do not thereby allow of Atomes Mathematicall or indiviſibles with <hi>Zeno;</hi> of which point ſee <hi>Arriaga,</hi> and our learned countreyman and Philoſopher <hi>Compton</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Carleton.</hi> Neither again do we with <hi>Epicurus</hi> and ſome other old Philoſophers, maintain any caſual meeting or accidentall confluence of them; but contrariwiſe, an aſſembling of them in generation by the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114895:9"/>force of ſeminall or ſpermatick virtue, deſcending from the forms into the ſperme or ſeeds, and by the Creatour infuſed at the firſt creation into the forms. As for the compoſition it ſelf abſtracting from theſe particulars, it was alſo taught by <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> when he affirmed all to be in all, or every thing, and to have a preexiſtence in the boſome of nature, even before ſuch time as, by the operation of ſeminall cauſes, forms be accompliſhed and made to appear in their own likeneſſe upon this theatre. This is alſo the judgement of <hi>Athanaſ. Kircherius</hi> a late learned writer <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>de magnete, part.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. where he ſhews how rich compounds earth and water be, as <hi>Chymick</hi> induſtries for ſeparation have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, inſomuch as he noteth, there is contained in them a <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or generall magazine; the common matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the firſt creation not lean and hungry, but <hi>foeta</hi> and <hi>praeſeminata</hi> with forms partiall and incompleat. This alſo is the inchoations of forms and the <hi>rationes ſeminales</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent, which many learned men have often favoured, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly taught by the great <hi>Albertus</hi> 1. <hi>Phyſ. tract.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 1. <hi>part. ſummae tract.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 14. <hi>ar.</hi> 2. <hi>memb.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; tract.</hi> 6. <hi>q.</hi> 26. <hi>ar.</hi> 2. <hi>memb.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; part.</hi> 2. <hi>tract.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 4. <hi>ar.</hi> 1. <hi>memb.</hi> 2. Which doctrine of his being explained in this ſenſe declared, lies no way within the danger of the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Gandavenſis, Durandus, Dominicus de Flandria,</hi> or <hi>Thomas de Argentina,</hi> who all proceed againſt it according to a way of underſtanding, though true in it ſelf, yet quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from this, and alſo, as we may juſtly think, from the true meaning of <hi>Albertus,</hi> or of <hi>Jacobus de Viterbo,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the afore-nominated <hi>Argentina l.</hi> 2. <hi>ſent. diſt.</hi> 18. <hi>ar.</hi> 2. and there impugned by him. The ſame doctrine for inchoations of forms in the matter before generation, I mean not in <hi>materia prima,</hi> but in <hi>ſecunda</hi> &amp; <hi>praeſeminata,</hi> is largely declared, proved, and defended by our learned coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyman <hi>Jo. Bacon</hi> a <hi>Carmelite, l.</hi> 1. <hi>Quodlibet q.</hi> 6. and alſo in 2. <hi>ſentent. diſt.</hi> 18. <hi>q. unica,</hi> in which latter place he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114895:9"/>ſhews that this doctrine is according to the meaning of S. <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> Theſe ſame inchoations are the <hi>rationes primordiales</hi> concreated with the matter, in whoſe boſome they lie as it were a ſleep, untill ſuch time as by the genitall power and agency of forms, which are in perfection and diſplaid, they be called out and united, not accidentally, but ſubſtantially, into one <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> which <hi>Compoſitum</hi> when it is to be diſſolved, all thoſe unfolded <hi>ſeminall reaſons</hi> do ſhrink up again, and withdraw themſelves into the ſelf ſame beds from which they came. And this is the doctrine of <hi>Albertus</hi> and <hi>Bacon,</hi> although they do not deſcend to ſuch particulars as be expreſſed here, but hold themſelves aloof, according to the cuſtome of the Schools, in more generall principles and expreſſions.</p>
               <p>This, laſtly, is nothing elſe but, in a good ſenſe, an edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of forms <hi>ex potentia materiae,</hi> which is <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> and his Diſciples Doctrine; for it cannot be thought that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ever intended to preſſe or ſqueez any forms out of the dry <hi>skeleton</hi> of <hi>matersa prima,</hi> which matter is a principle onely receptive, and no promptuary out of which to educe a form by virtue of any naturall agent whatſoever; for in ſuch a ſpare entity as that what fecundity is imaginable?</p>
               <p>And ſo much touching the original of forms, which is one of the abſtruſeſt and niceſt points in all philoſophy, and that which by vulgar Authours is meanlieſt handled, and by the wiſeſt is known but by conjecture.</p>
               <p>Thus his main argument is anſwered, after which all the reſt will fall down headlong with any light touch, though but of a finger.</p>
               <p>Immediately after this he argueth out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. where <hi>Adam</hi> is told, that for his diſobedience he muſt turn into that duſt of which he was made; out of which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that all and every part of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt be converted into duſt: which if it be ſo as he ſaith, then not onely his earthly particles, but his aiery, watery, and fiery parts muſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114895:10"/>to duſt alſo, and not onely his body, but his ſoul, if he have any, muſt be turned into the ſame matter. See what fine concluſions follow out of this mortall ſouls philoſophy. It ſufficed then, that ſo much of his body, or of the whole man, was to return to duſt as had been made up of it. And by this alone the commination of God is fulfilled without any more ado.</p>
               <p>After this he comes upon us with his falſe Latine, ſaying as followeth. <q>Death reduceth this <hi>productio entis ex non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente ad Non-entens,</hi> returns man to what he was before he was</q>: that is, not to be, &amp;c. and by and by, citing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently two or three places of Scripture, falls to another argument drawn from the reſurrection.</p>
               <p>As for the Latine word <hi>Non-entem,</hi> whether it be right or no, we will not examine, but apply our ſelves to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the ſenſe, which is as faulty as the Latine can be: know therefore in brief, that death did not reduce <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>non ens,</hi> but to <hi>non Adam;</hi> it did not cauſe him abſolutely not to be, but onely not to be man or <hi>Adam</hi> any longer. And foraſmuch as concerns his body, it is confeſt and certain, that it was not turned by death or mortality in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing, or <hi>non ens,</hi> but into duſt, which is an <hi>ens,</hi> or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; that is to ſay, his body was not <hi>annihilated,</hi> but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; and to die, is not wholly to be deſtroyed but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally onely, which act is all one with diſſolution. Now if to the totall mortalizing of man it be not neceſſary that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be deſtroyed, then can it not be needfull that his ſoul ſhould be ſo: and thus our adverſaries ſtout argument is more then mortalized, for it comes to nothing, which man by dying doth not.</p>
               <p>We will not deny him but that the ſoul of man did die and die again, as much as it was capable of death; for firſt it died by the being ſeparated from the body, although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, according to a philoſophical propriety of ſpeaking, this ſame ſeparation of it be no death, or true manner of dying:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114895:10"/>ſecondly, by being ſubjected unto damnation, which, as we know, is called in Scripture a ſecond death. But as for the annihilation of it or of the body, that is it which we deny; and ſo to do we have juſt reaſon. In fine, as Generation is nothing but the union of the parts, and not the creation or abſolute production of them; ſo again, Death and Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is nothing but the diſunion, or diſſolution of them, and in no wiſe the annihilation, according as this wiſe Authour would perſwade us,</p>
               <p>As for the article of the Reſurrection, it proves nothing againſt the perpetuity of the ſoul; for we never read of any reſurrection beſides that of the body: wherefore to averre a reſurrection of ſouls were a grand foolery, and a doctrine never debateable or heard of amongſt Chriſtians, till this ſilly Authour came to teach it. And ſo much for his firſt chapter.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114895:11"/>for certainly this one verity of the immortality of mans ſoul, is that which is to order mans deſigns, to regulate his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to put life and vigour into them, this being a truth moſt fundamentall.

               <p>After this ſort do anxious and afflicted ſpirits often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times argue and diſpute within themſelves, laying before their eyes all the doubts and difficulties imaginable, before they deſcend to the making of any concluſion at all, or to the determining of any ſetled doctrine. Thus and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe did <hi>Solomon,</hi> when firſt revolving in his thoughts the matter of the ſouls condition, and touching upon the various ſuſpicions of men concerning it, with no ſmall ſenſe and anguiſh of mind, at length <hi>Eccleſ. c.</hi> 12. drawing to a concluſion, he determines, ſaying, <hi>Let the duſt return unto the earth from whence it came, and the ſpirit unto God who gave it.</hi> And this text alone is ſufficient to confound the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and to confute whatſoever he hath endeavoured to draw out of Scripture for mans totall corruption and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
               <p>I adde, according to good Expoſitours, that <hi>Solomon</hi> in this place repreſenteth not what he himſelf did judge, nor what a rationall man ought to judge, but rather what <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans</hi> and voluptuous perſons did, or were wont to judge, according either to the deſires, or at leaſt to the apparences of ſenſe; for according to them, man and beaſt do breathe out their laſts alike; but this judgement of theirs <hi>Solomon</hi> abſolutely condemns, as appeareth plainly by that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath been alledged out of him.</p>

               <p>WHat the ſeverall fancies were of heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers touching the nature and definition of the ſoul, is not much regardable, ſundry of them being ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and abſurd. But it is a thing very conſiderable, that amongſt ſo many ſtragling and wild conceits, all, or moſt of all at leaſt of the nobleſt and the beſt Philoſophers, have taught the immortality of the ſoul it ſelf: howſoever, in other buſineſſes concerning it they might ſometimes diſagree. <hi>Permanere animos arbitramur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cicero Tuſcul. l.</hi> 1. <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſu nationum omnium: qua in ſede maneant, qualeſque ſint ratione diſcendum eſt:</hi> and again in his <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth Saint <hi>Auguſtine l.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 19. <hi>de Trinitate.

Again, <hi>in Somnio Scipionis</hi> he determineth, ſaying, <hi>Infra Lunam nihil eſt niſi mortale &amp; caducum, praeter animos generi hominum Deorum munere datos.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Moon there is nothing which is not corruptible, excepting ſouls alone beſtowed upon mankind by the muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of the Gods.

This aſſertion of <hi>Cicero,</hi> for conſent of Nations and Philoſophers in this truth, hath been ſhewed to the eye by the great diligence and learning of <hi>Auguſtinus Steuchus,</hi> commonly called <hi>Eugubinus,</hi> in the 9 book of his excellent work <hi>de perenni Philoſophia,</hi> in which he voucheth to this purpoſe the authorities of <hi>Phere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ides Syrus,</hi> who as <hi>Cicero</hi> witneſſeth, was the firſt that delivered this verity in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114895:12"/>writing, alſo of <hi>Triſmegiſtus,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldean</hi> monuments of <hi>Plato,</hi> likewiſe <hi>Pythagoras, Aratus, Philo, Cicero, Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus, Jamblichus, Hierocles,</hi> and ſundry others, as alſo of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the Prince of the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> who is judged by the greateſt ſearchers into his doctrine to have directly taught the immortality, although he had not declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in that point, as in many others, nor as others have done, peradventure concealing himſelf on ſet purpoſe, becauſe he for want of light from divine revelation, was not able to tell what to do with them after death, nor was he willing to make up his matter with fictions poeticall, as his maſter <hi>Plato</hi> had done before him; and this very reaſon of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotles</hi> reſervedneſſe in this point is rendred by <hi>Toſtatus, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 54. <hi>&amp;</hi> 55. For this cauſe peradventure, he held it more expedient to leave his judgement of the ſouls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to be gathered out of the conſequence of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and words, let fall here and there, as it were by chance, rather then to deliver it in expreſſe terms, or to handle the queſtion on ſet purpoſe. It was enough for him, 1. <hi>Ethic. c.</hi> 11. to have ſaid, that the fortunes of poſterity good or bad were a concernment of the dead; becauſe, out of this one aſſertion his mind might come to be known: for of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that which is not can have no concernment, wherefore the ſouls of the deceaſed were ſuppoſed by <hi>Aristotle</hi> to have a being, and conſequently to be ſtill alive, and alſo to live intellectually; becauſe firſt of all, as the Philoſopher teacheth, <hi>Viventibus eſſe eſt vivere,</hi> To be and to live, is with creatures indued with life all one thing, ſo that with them to kill is as much as to annihilate; ſecondly, by the ſame reaſon <hi>Intellectualibus eſſe eſt intelligere,</hi> With creatures intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, their being is to be intellectuall, or to live intellectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſo that if the intellectuall part of them be extinguiſhed, they periſh wholly, and have neither life nor being left them. In conſideration of this we may ſay, that it is no matter at all to <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> for example, whether thoſe of his race
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114895:13"/>proved jades or metall'd horſes: and why is this? becauſe <hi>Bucephalus</hi> is extinguiſhed &amp; hath no life nor being: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> it is a matter to the prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, whether their poſterity prove good or bad, happy or miſerable; and why then muſt this be, but becauſe theſe have life, though <hi>Bucephalus</hi> had none, theſe have a being intellectuall, <hi>Bucephalus</hi> hath none at all? Other places alſo of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> are conſonant to this, as we may find in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellus l.</hi> 3. <hi>de Animae q.</hi> 3. and again <hi>tract.</hi> 1. <hi>de Indefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia Anima:</hi> in the <hi>Conimbricenſes tract. de Animaſepar. diſp.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 2. and laſtly in <hi>Albertinus tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Corollariorum.</hi> Moreover, <hi>Plutarch.</hi> in <hi>l. de Conſol. ad Apollonium,</hi> out of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> book <hi>de Anim. ad Eudemum,</hi> reciteth this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage following, as the words of <hi>Silenus</hi> unto <hi>Midas.</hi> 
                  <q>Wherefore, ſaith <hi>Silenus,</hi> O moſt noble and happy, ſeeing we eſteem thoſe who are departed this life to be happy and bleſſed, we hold it a thing very wicked to ſpeak of them any thing that is falſe or contumelious, by that they now are made partakers of a better and more noble na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and this opinion of ours is ſo ancient, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour and the beginning thereof be wholly unknown, but by an infinite deſcent of ages hath been devolved upon us.</q> Thus reporteth <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and it is not unlike but <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> who alledged it was of the ſame mind; and this is probable ſo much the more, becauſe his chief ſcholar <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> a man almoſt equall to himſelf, is confeſſed to have been very poſitive in this doctrine of immortality. The ſame Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers alſo are diligently alledged by <hi>Monſieur Pleſſy,</hi> in his book <hi>de veritate Relig. Chriſtianae c.</hi> 15. which is every where extant. Beſides, the ſame doctrine of immortality hath been conſtantly taught by the learned <hi>Aben Sina,</hi> or <hi>Avicen</hi> in the laſt book of his <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> and alſo in his <hi>Almahad,</hi> in which treatiſe he maintaineth conſtantly the immortality of the ſoul, but earneſtly impugneth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies reſurrection, and withall, which is moſt falſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114895:13"/>defends that <hi>Mahomet</hi> in his law never taught it, but onely parabolically and for faſhion ſake, complying with the peoples rudeneſſe, whereby they were not ſenſible of any doctrine teaching a felicity that was ſpirituall. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Arabick</hi> Authour, who goes under the name of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> is of the ſame minde with <hi>Avicen:</hi> Seeing, ſaith he, <q>it is manifeſt out of the books of the ancient, and alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proved, that the ſoul or minde is not a body, nor doth periſh, but remain, &amp;c.</q> Thus he <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>de divin. ſap. ſecundum Aegyptios, c.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 1. &amp; 12. conſonantly to other Philoſophers, though afterwards, in the very next chapter, moſt abſurdly he affirms as much of the ſouls of Beaſts. But his reaſon was, becauſe he thought the ſouls of men did, after their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, paſſe into the bodies of brute beaſts by a tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration <hi>Pythagoricall.</hi> Afterwards <hi>c.</hi> 4. he addeth, ſaying: <q>If our fore elders had been doubtfull of the ſouls immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, they had never, for the confirmation thereof by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures dictamen, made a law againſt which no man is, but he who is entangled in vice.

Indeed, a ſoul deſtitute of reaſon follows the affections of the body, for it deſires and is angry without reaſon; but a rationall, according to the rule of reaſon, contemnes the body, and entring into combate with the ſoul irrationall, if it get the better doth follow virtue, if vanquiſht declines to vice. This of neceſſity muſt be immortall, becauſe it knows the Gods, and no mortall thing can know that which is immortall; beſides, it contemnes humane things, as if they were belonging to ſome other perſon, and being it ſelf incorporeall, is averſe from things corporeall, which bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, if they be fair and freſh, it languiſheth, if old, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to flouriſh. Alſo every diligent ſoul makes uſe of the mind. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; the ſoul is not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114895:15"/>generated by the body, for how ſhould any thing that wanteth reaſon generate that which hath it? Thus <hi>Salluſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> out of whoſe words we have, firſt, That the ſoul dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the body. 2. That the rationall from the irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, or the ſenſe.</q> 3. That the rationall is immortall, and the reaſon why. 4. That it is ingenerable, and for what cauſe. With this Greek <hi>Sallustius</hi> agrees the Roman, who <hi>l. de bello Jugurth.</hi> ſaieth, <hi>Ingenii egregia facinora, ſicut anima immortalia ſunt:</hi> The egregious atchievements of the wit are like the ſoul immortall: and, by and by, <hi>Omnia orta occidunt, aucta ſeneſcunt, animus incorruptus, aeternus, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor humani generis:</hi> All things which riſe do fall, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing increaſed do wax old, the minde is incorrupt and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From theſe Philoſophers we deſcend to inquire after the diſciples of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> being deſirous to learn what their opinion was, of which we are to make no ſmall account, they being the chief <hi>Myſtae,</hi> or <hi>Hierophantae</hi> of nature, and men moſt knowing, eſpecially in the tranſmutation of bodies; and not onely in the Anatomizing by diſſection of ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as be organicall, but alſo of others by the Art of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry, which teaches how to diſſolve naturall compounds, though not ſo farre as into their firſt elements, yet into their ſecondary parts of compoſition. True it is, that divers of this excellent profeſſion have been ſuſpected of ſome ſiniſter cogitations touching the immortall ſoul, as namely, that it was like that of beaſts, that is to ſay, onely a thin and fading exhalation raiſed out of the pure ſubſtance of the bloud, &amp;c. But I muſt do them right; ſuch of them as have been guilty of theſe thoughts, or rather mean conceptions, were not any of their Grandees, no <hi>Apollines,</hi> nor <hi>Aeſculapii,</hi> but, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, men of a farre meaner condition, and onely of a midling ſize at the moſt, ſuch, I ſay, as, by reaſon of their weaker underſtandings, have loſt themſelves amongſt the rubbiſh of materiall and groſſer objects and there periſhed.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114895:15"/>Whereas the diviner underſtandings have ſped better, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able, from materiall things, to take a higher flight, and by a curious inſpection into the effects, to finde out the firſt cauſe and mover, and by the diviner operations of the ſoul, to conclude the immortality thereof. And of this eminent ſort, in our dayes <hi>Italy</hi> hath afforded us an <hi>Argenterius</hi> &amp; a <hi>Jul.

As then, as <hi>Cicero</hi> obſerveth they were <hi>Minutuli,</hi> little petty Philoſophers, who denied the ſouls immortality, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may we ſay that thoſe Phyſicians who did the ſame, were but an inferiour ſort of men, and half-witted, in compariſon of thoſe other who did maintain it. And as for <hi>Galen,</hi> a moſt principall maſter in that profeſſion, he inclineth to the aſſerting of immortality; for though ſometimes he ſeem much perplexed, not knowing what to determine, then, namely, when he onely conſidered how the habilities of the minde held a conſtant proportion with the ſeverall ſtructures and temperatures of the body, riſing and falling with them; yet at other times, when he beheld the ſublimer operations of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

Verily, it ſeems to me that the thing which we term hote and heat, is ſomething which is not mortall.</hi> So he, according as we finde him cited by <hi>Fernelius</hi> in the place before quoted; and ſo much for the honour of Phyſicians in order to this truth.</p>
               <p>Our next authority is that of <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus</hi> that famous Pythagorean Philoſopher, whoſe life <hi>Philoſtratus Lemnius</hi> hath writ at large, and amongſt other accidents, <hi>l.</hi> 8. relates of him how, after his deceaſe, he appeared to a young man a ſtudent in philoſophy, reſolving him as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <q>The ſoul is immortall, and no humane thing, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the providence divine.

               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> the famous Stoicks minde may be learned eaſily out
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114895:16"/>of his three ſeverall conſolatory Tractates; namely, to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius, Helvia</hi> and <hi>Martia,</hi> and <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 121. as alſo out of other places whereſoever occaſion was given. His words to <hi>Martia</hi> be theſe. <hi>Mobilis &amp; inquieta mens homini data eſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A minde,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>restleſſe and unquiet is given unto man, and no wonder, if we look up unto the firſt Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; it is no concretion of any dull or earthly body, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth from a ſpirit celeſtiall, is to be in motion inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: it flyeth and is carried on with a ſwift courſe,</hi> &amp;c. Thus he, out of whoſe words we may gather three things; firſt, that the ſoul is from above, and not by any naturall genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Secondly, that it is immortall. Thirdly, that after once it is releaſed from corporeall Organs, it acts continually, and never ſleepeth.</p>
               <p>I will adde to theſe the words of the Emperour <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> commonly called <hi>Aurel. de vita ſua l.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 13. according to <hi>Merick Caſaubon's</hi> diviſion. <q>If ſouls, ſaith he, remain, how from all eternity could the aire hold them, or how the earth retain their bodies?

               <p>The ſame doctrine is conſtantly taught by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> as appears by his doctrine of <hi>Metempſychoſis</hi> and <hi>Palingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> as alſo both <hi>Jamblichus</hi> and <hi>Porphyry</hi> in their ſeverall hiſtories of his life do witneſſe of him, as alſo <hi>Diogenes La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crtius.

And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as concerneth the ſame <hi>Dicaearchus,</hi> we reade in

               <p>As for <hi>Epicurus</hi> and his aſſociates, they cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to give ſentence here, and therefore their adverſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not prejudiciall to our cauſe. Firſt, becauſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Epicureans</hi> were ſlaves to voluptuouſneſſe and vice, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Philoſophy onely as a cloak wherewith to palliate their enormities. Secondly, becauſe they themſelves are guilty perſons, and that in a high manner alſo; for although, as <hi>Toſtatus in Geneſ.</hi> determineth, the right <hi>Epicureans</hi> were men of great gravity, yet they offended groſſely againſt the light of nature in ſundry paſſages of Philoſophy concerning the higheſt verities. Moreover, though <hi>Petrus Gaſſendus</hi> in his late voluminous tractates <hi>De vita &amp; Philoſophia Epicuri,</hi> hath freed <hi>Epicurus</hi> from many foul objections and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and with much labour hath waſhed him, and wrung him, and perfumed him; yet many ſtains do reſt behind, which with all his art he was not able to fetch out; neither could he ſweeten him ſo fully, but that he ſmells ſtill of the hogge-ſty, and that alſo ſo ſtrongly, as he is not fit to enter into the Senate-houſe of Philoſophy, or to have a voice therein allowed him. What was the occaſion of his errour is needleſſe to examine, but the errour it ſelf, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons brought for it by <hi>Lucretius,</hi> are exactly refuted by the ſame <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> as alſo his other impious doctrines.</p>
               <p>Neither, again, can the words of <hi>Pomponatius</hi> and <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moninus</hi> be of any weight, although they be men much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored by ſome ſuperſtitious followers of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> for if we conſider theſe two men attentively, we ſhall find them to be wooden Idols, becauſe their chief talent lay onely in canvaſing ſeverall texts of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and, foot by foot, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114895:18"/>out his ſenſes and wayes of diſcourſing: ſo that, in fine, they are rather Commentatous then Philoſophers a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers office being to prove his doctrines by reaſon and ſtrength of argument, which way theſe two never take; but yet doubtleſſe would have done, if their habilities had ſerved them for it. Wherefore theſe men are of too low a claſſe to be made Judges here, and have not law enough in them for the deciding of the controverſie in hand.</p>
               <p>After theſe Philoſophers of name, which I have alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as favourers and aſſerters of immortality, I produce the whole companies of the <hi>Eſſeni,</hi> the <hi>Druides,</hi> the <hi>Magi,</hi> the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts,</hi> the <hi>Brachmans,</hi> all which were tribes and Schools of ſelected ſpirits, that in ſeverall ages and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions did profeſſe Philoſophy, and all ſubſcribed to this one truth, as we may find in <hi>Pliny, Caeſar, Joſephus, Solinus, Mela, Philoſtratus, Diodorus, Porphyrius,</hi> and others. Neither can it be any prejudice to the authority of all theſe, that during the night of Gentiliſme, an <hi>Epicurus,</hi> or a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caearchus,</hi> though men of note, ſhould ſtumble and fall into an errour: but now after the ſun is up, it were a great ſhame for a <hi>Pomponatius,</hi> or a <hi>Cremoninus</hi> to fall into a ditch, and teach ſuch doctrine as the wiſeſt of the moſt early ages judged to be erroneus and abſurd.</p>
               <p>But now, by the way, I note how ſublimely moſt of theſe heathen wiſe men did Philoſophize, when as they conclude the ſouls originall to be from heaven, and how much above the low pitch of certain depreſſed ſpirits of this age, who after their continuall poring into objects materiall, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the mudde of corruptible things, will needs draw out of that dirt the nobler ſubſtances of our ſouls and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures intellectuall, by aſſigning for them no more perfect principle then generation; of which number this ſorry Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, againſt whom we now deal, is one, yea and one alſo of the groſſeſt that ever medled about this buſineſſe, as by his demeanour in it doth appear. <hi>Hierocles</hi> in expreſſe terms
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114895:18"/>determines ſaying, <q>It ſeems, ſaith he, that God himſelf produced the ſeverall ſouls of every particular man, and left the ſouls of Beaſts to be produced by the hand of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, according to the judgements of <hi>Plato</hi> and of <hi>Timaeus</hi> the Pythagorean.</q> So he <hi>com. in caerm. aurea Pythagorae pag:</hi> 133. of the Greek and Latine Edition of <hi>Paris An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> 1583.</p>
               <p>I know well, that amongſt theſe ancients the word <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Let us come now unto our Authour, who would gladly father upon <hi>Aristotle, Nemeſius,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſius Paraeus,</hi> that the ſoul is all the externall and internall faculties of man jointly conſidered. Which charge is ſtrange ſeeing it is well known that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines the ſoul after no ſuch way, but ſaith it is <hi>Actus corporis Organici,</hi> and a ſubſtance by which we live, have ſenſe, and do underſtand; and if a ſubſtance, then can it not receive intenſion and remiſſion, as every young Logician hath learned.</p>
               <p>The ancient and learned writer <hi>Nemeſius,</hi> whom the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary alledgeth, doth no way favour him. Firſt, becauſe, at that time both he and ſundry others did hold that ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſouls were created before their bodies; but the faculties organicall and externall, could not be then created. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe <hi>l. de natura hom. c.</hi> 1. he delivers doctrine dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite to that for which this Authour doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him. <q>Moreover, ſaith <hi>Nemeſius,</hi> the ſoul is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, becauſe ſuſceptible of contrarieties; it is a ſubject, but harmony a qualitie. Now ſubſtance and quality be things diſtinct, and therefore the ſoul from harmony: and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114895:19"/>though it may have harmony in it, yet is it not therefore any harmony, no more then it is a virtue therefore becauſe it is partaker of virtue. <hi>Galen</hi> determines nothing of this point, witneſſing in his book <hi>de Demonſt.</hi> that he hath affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med nothing of the ſoul: yet that he doth ſay ſheweth him inclinable to judge it to be a temperature therefore, becauſe the difference in manners does follow it, and this he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to confirm out of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> If this be ſo, then doubtleſſe he holds it to be mortall, though not all, but ſo much onely of it as is devoid of reaſon, for of that portion of it he in theſe words makes a queſtion ...... But, that the ſoul cannot be a complexion, or temperature of the body, it appeareth hence, namely, becauſe every body, &amp;c.</q> Hitherto <hi>Nemeſius,</hi> whoſe doctrine as we may ſee is flatly oppoſite to the Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>His pretenſion to <hi>Ambroſe Paraeus,</hi> a late writer of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgery, is as wide from the mark as this other before of <hi>Nemeſius</hi> was, as may appear plainly by the peruſall of <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 1. &amp; <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>l.</hi> 23. wherein his doctrine is very good, and alſo conſonant to that which is delivered commonly, and we here defend. Wherefore let us now hear further.</p>
               <p>All the faculties of man are mortall, as well thoſe peculiar to man, as thoſe other which are common to him with beaſts: and if all thoſe with his corpulent matter compleating man be proved mortall, then the invention of the ſoul upon that ground vaniſheth, which thus I prove.</p>
               <p>All elementary compoſitions or temperatures are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. But mans faculties, <hi>à minore ad majus,</hi> are tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>Ergo</hi> mortall.</p>
               <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is denied, namely that all mans faculties be temperatures; for, to inſtance, neither the underſtanding nor the will be temperatures, and yet are principall faculties of man.</p>
               <p>He proves the <hi>minor.</hi> That which is ſubject to intenſion and remiſſion is a temperature.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:114895:19"/>
               <p>But ſuch are all mans faculties, yea thoſe of reaſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, ſcience &amp;c. All that diſtinguiſheth man from beaſt is augmented by learning, education, &amp;c. leſſened by negligence, idleneſſe; and quite nullified by madneſſe. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this killing argument there be but two propoſitions falle, that is to ſay, both the <hi>major</hi> and the <hi>minor</hi> of it, and then what kind of concluſion it hath we may eaſily judge. For firſt, it is falſe that every thing is a temperature, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally ſpeaking, which is ſubject to intenſion and remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, excepting ſuch things onely as be ſubject unto them <hi>per ſe</hi> and by their own nature, and not by accident onely: and this appears in the very buſineſſe now in agitation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; for a greater clerk then this man is, will hardly ever prove that the augment or diminution, which is found in the acts of knowledge, do ariſe from any internal alteration in the intellective faculty, and not contrariwiſe from the difference, advantage, and alteration in the organ, or the ſpecies and forms intentionall: for this reaſon therefore, a man may underſtand better then a child, namely, not becauſe his faculty intellective is better then a childs, but onely for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe in the organ; alſo a learned man better then an illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and a diligent then a negligent, becauſe thoſe may have acquired more ſpecies, or forms intentionall, or elſe have kept them better then theſe other that be illiterate and negligent, and not for any intenſion or remiſſion in the faculty. This I ſay may be the reaſon of the difference, and is likely ſo to be, and not any variation in the faculty it ſelf, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing which this Authour hath ſaid; and therefore this proof of his is defective and of no validity.</p>
               <p>In the ſame ſenſe we deny the <hi>minor</hi> alſo: for it does not follow that the faculties rationall be more or leſſe, becauſe the acts of it be more or leſſe, in regard that there may be more cauſes then one of this intenſion or remiſſion, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the different perfection of the organ, as well as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114895:20"/>meaſure of the faculty it ſelf. Wherefore it belongeth to this Authour to prove that this ebbing or flowing of acts of knowledge, is to be referred to the ſoul's or underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's wanings and increaſes, and not to the differences of the organs; which thing ſince he faileth to do, his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can by no means conclude, or be admitted as good.</p>
               <p>He argueth again. Temperature is a quality. A quality may be abſent without the deſtruction of the ſubject. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and underſtanding may be ſo: therefore they are tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratures, or qualities, and not ſubſtances immortall. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is proved by example of madneſſe, falling ſickneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In anſwer, Firſt, I deny it to follow, that becauſe Reaſon is a quality, therefore it is a temperature, for there be many qualities which neither are temperatures nor belong unto them, becauſe no other qualities belong to temperature, but onely ſuch as be elementary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I deny abſolutely that reaſon or underſtanding can be abſent without the deſtruction of the ſoul, or of man. I know the act of reaſon may be abſent, and the effluence of it hindred, more or leſſe, as in infants, mad men, a pople<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick perſons, and ſuch like, but ſtill the root remains, and without death cannot be removed. Hence I inferre againſt this Authour, that although ſundry actuall intellections may be improved, or impaired by ſenſe, yet the radicall cannot, but is wholly independent. Nay further, even ſome acts of the ſoul are in the manner of working independent of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and wholly inorganicall, as divers learned Authours have ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Some old authours have aſcribed to the ſoul a body Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereall; but that it ſelf was a body Aercall or Elementary, I conceive none of them ever yet affirmed. What that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure writer ſaith whom he calleth <hi>Woolnor,</hi> I neither know nor regard, for he is no claſſicall Authour, nor hath any voice allowed him in the Philoſophers Parliament.</p>
               <p>The ſeverall abſurdities: which afterwards this Authour
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114895:20"/>labours to inferre, do not follow out of the doctrine of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, but onely out of his own miſtakes, erroneous and ignorant conceptions, and therefore he may take them all home to himſelf, which to do, I know it muſt be to his great loſſe; for throughout his whole book he ſwarms ſo much with this kind of vermine, as they eat up all the ſubſtance of his undertakings and diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>He addeth. Every form depends of the matter, and by ſeparation periſhes. But we muſt tell him that this is falſe doctrine and can never be proved. If it were not ſo, ſaith he, then one might be generated without the other, a ſoul with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a body, and a woman be brought to bed of a ſpirit.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That an immortall ſoul cannot at all be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; as firſt, being by it ſelf and its own nature ingenerable; and ſecondly, having no principle here on earth, either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall or efficient, that is able to beget it, all agents created in this kind being impotent, as afterwards we intend to ſhew againſt this Authour, as alſo againſt <hi>Sennertus, Religio Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici,</hi> and ſome others.</p>
               <p>What reaſon is there, ſaith he, mans and beaſts Anatomy being both conſidered and compared together, that mans fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in a higher degree ſhould be an immortall ſpirit, more then beaſts in a lower degree, but both elementary and finite?</p>
               <p>For the finiteneſſe we grant you that both are finite, but not both elementary, or mortall: and this we collect not from the Anatomy, but from the operations, by which we do collect not a graduall difference betwixt the two ſouls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall and humane, but an eſſentiall.

                  </note> So that call it reaſon which is in beaſts, or call it what you will that reaſon which is in man is eſſentially ſuperiour unto it: and if that of beaſts be reaſon, then doth mans reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve another better term whereby to ſignifie the eſſentiall preheminence of it, as <hi>Campanellae</hi> himſelf acknowledges in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114895:21"/>divers works of his, and proves in his Metaphyſicks at large. We know that bordering nations do a little ſymbolize in their natures, but yet are not therefore the ſame: ſo then, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the higheſt of vegetables, as the <hi>herba viva,</hi> or the <hi>Agnus Tartaricus</hi> (if there be ſuch a plant) and the <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophyta,</hi> have ſome reſemblance to creatures of ſenſe, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe are they different from them, and the <hi>Zoophyta</hi> themſelves belong onely to one claſſe or other, and not to both. So, in like ſort, although the moſt perfect of animals have acts of ſenſation that ſomething reſemble the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, diſcurſive, and judging faculties of man, yet are they wholly and eſſentially diſtinct. Wherefore, as ſome erroneouſly may imagine, the ſenſe in beaſts is not a weak or imperfect reaſon; nor again, in man is reaſon a ſtrong and perfect ſenſe, for theſe two faculties be wholly different even in one and the ſame man, as manifeſtly appeareth, Firſt, by the ſeverall degrees of ſubordinate perfections found in creatures, which perfections, whenſoever extant in ſeverall ſorts of creatures, be ſpecifically, or eſſentially diſtinct; as namely, the degree of vegetation is diſtinguiſhed from that other next inferiour to it in all things that be deſtitute of life; &amp; ſo again, is the degree ſuperiour of ſenſation from the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of vegetation: wherefore in like ſort, &amp; in proportion to theſe, we are to think that the degree of reaſon, though never ſo imperfect, is eſſentially diſtinct from that of ſenſe, though never ſo perfect, and is ſuperiour unto it. As then it would be no ſmall abſurdity for us to confound the confining de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of life and no life, ſenſe and vegetation; ſo alſo would it be to confound ſenſe and reaſon, and to allow between them a difference no greater then accidentall <hi>ſecundum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis &amp; minus.</hi> Secondly, the ſame appeareth by the different objects of either faculty; Reaſon, for example, is ſenſible of religion, of ſpirits, of future times, of ſhame, of compaſſion; but Brutes have no ſenſe at all of theſe, no feeling of them, neither more nor leſſe, neither perfect nor imperfect. But if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114895:21"/>the degrees of ſenſe and reaſon differed onely accidentally, that is to ſay, according to greater or leſſe graduall perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and no more; then would it follow that whatſoever reaſon apprehends perfectly, ſenſe alſo would apprehend, at leaſt imperfectly, in one degree or other; which ſeeing ſenſe does not, we may ſafely inferre from thence, that reaſon is eſſentially different from ſenſe, and again, that ſenſe is not an imperfect reaſon, but contrariwiſe no reaſon at all, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect nor imperfect.</p>
               <p>Again, we ſee that Reaſon bridles Senſe, and, like a ſhoar, confines it, and therefore Reaſon and Senſe are no more one thing, then the Bridle and the Horſe or then the Shoar and the Ocean. Of which point more may be ſeen in <hi>Aquinas</hi> &amp; his Commentatour <hi>Ferrarienſis l.</hi> 2. <hi>cont. Gentes c.</hi> 66.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſame alſo doth appear out of the contrariety and diſagreement which we daily do experience betwixt the two judgements of reaſon and ſenſe, as alſo between the two appetites ſenſuall and rationall, and the great repugnancy we find between them throughout our whole life, and by the great buſineſſe and ſharp conflicts which are cauſed thereby, much to our coſt and labour.</p>
               <p>The oppoſition betwixt the indication of ſenſe and the judgement of reaſon is evident: becauſe the ſenſe, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, judgeth the ſunnes diameter to be but a ſpan; reaſon here oppoſeth, and concludeth it to be much greater then the diameter of the whole earth. Infinite other examples might be given, but this one may ſuffice for all.</p>
               <p>The diſagreement of the two appetites, and how they draw ſeverall waies, and torture the heart of man, is evident, Firſt, by every mans experience; Secondly, by the ſuffrages of the Genes. <hi>Ovid</hi> brings in <hi>Medaea</hi> complaining tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in theſe words, <hi>Metamorph. l.</hi> 17.

The ſame leſſon is taught us by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his life extant in the <hi>Bibliotheca</hi> of <hi>Photius.</hi> 
                  <q>Wherefore, ſaith the Authour, we being made up of various faculties, do lead a toilſome life and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, forasmuch as every other creature is governed by one ſimple nature, but we by ſeverall, which natures do draw wayes contrary to one another; as namely, we are ſometimes moved to the better by that within us which is divine; but at other fits, the portion irrationall being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, we are overwrought unto the worſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But admit, ſay you, all this is ſo, yet it proves no pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar perfection in man above that of other creatures of ſenſe, becauſe this ſame contrariety of appetites is common to him with brute beaſts, for example, it is found in a dogge, which, having an appetite to a piece of meat, dares not touch it for fear of blows; lo then, here is one appetite of eating and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other contrary unto it, which is, of keeping his bones whole, which later being the greater, croſſes the former, and makes him to refrain.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:114895:22"/>
               <p>I anſwer, by denying that here is any contrariety between thoſe two appetites, but onely an accidentall inconſiſtency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the objects of them, which hinders him at that time from ſatisfying of them both: no contrariety, I ſay, becauſe one of them does not oppoſe directly, or condemne the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for he both likes the meat, and likes alſo the ſaving of his skinne harmleſſe, juſt as a man thieviſhly diſpoſed likes to ſteal a horſe, and likes alſo the keeping of his perſon ſafe from the ſeverity of the laws; in which caſe the dogge and the thief are much at one, both of them being diſpoſed like beaſts: but now with an honeſt and rationall man it is farre otherwiſe, for, as with one appetite he is incited to the ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the horſe, ſo with another he diſapproves it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes it as an act unjuſt and irrationall; and herein conſiſts the difference of theſe appetites from the former. So, in fine, although the objects of the appetites, ſuch as beaſts and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall men do covet, might be conſiſtent, as many times they may, as for example, that a man may both ſteal a horſe which he likes, and alſo eſcape the law, which to do he likes as well; yet, nevertheleſſe, the rationall appetite would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict and countermand the theft, as an act irrationall and unjuſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Holy Scripture is plentifull in this argument. <hi>The Spirit,</hi> ſaith our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>is willing, but the Fleſh is weak.</hi> And his Diſciples adviſe, <hi>Walk ye in the Spirit, and the deſires of the fleſh you ſhall not fulfill. The ſpirit covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt the fleſh, and the fleſh againſt the ſpirit. I find in my members a law leading me captive unto ſinne. I do not that which I will, &amp;c.</hi> Mark 14.38. Gal. 5.17. Rom. 7.22.23. Alſo Rom. 7.21. <hi>I am delighted with the law of God according to the interiour man, but in my loins I ſee another law repugnant to the law of God, and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating me in the law of ſinne.</hi> Yea, ſo apparent was this diſagreement, as that <hi>Galen. l.</hi> 5. <hi>de dogmat. Hippoc.</hi> thought they could not ſubſiſt in one and the ſame ſoul, and therefore
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114895:23"/>concludes, that in man there muſt be two different ſouls: and into this ſame errour afterwards fell the <hi>Manichees,</hi> as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> teſtifyeth. <hi>l. de duab. Animab. &amp; l.</hi> 1. <hi>Retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat. c.</hi> 9. Which erroneous believers deduced alſo falſly, that there were two firſt principles, or Gods, one of them good, the other bad; that from the good the rationall ſoul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and from the bad the ſenſuall; from one the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of good, from the other the deſires of evil. <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Ariſtotle, Julianus, Augustus, &amp;c.</hi> do all note this contrariety of deſires in man, but none do note the ſame to be in beaſts; for even <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Gryllus</hi> doth obſerve the contrary.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee what oppoſition reaſon finds in man from ſenſe: but reaſon cannot be contrary unto it ſelf, nor doth it ſtruggle and ſtrive with its own powers and dictamens: and therefore it is a different power from ſenſe. And ſo much in anſwer to this chapter, omitting the particular examination of his other inferences of abſurdities, as he calls them, againſt the doctrine of immortality, becauſe either they are anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beforehand in that which hath been ſaid already, or elſe are ſuch wretched fluffe as they can afford no matter for any ſenſible anſwer, or ſerious undertaking.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Out of this it may be inferred, not that immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death we all ſhall be preſent with God, and attain to glory, as this Authour idlely objecteth; but that during the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114895:23"/>time of our abſence from the body, we may be preſent with Chriſt and enjoy God, whether this be immediately after death, or no, about which point we do not now contend.</p>
               <p>His anſwer is, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks not of the interim betwixt Death and the laſt Judgement, but of the ſtate of the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>This Gloſſe of his corrupts the Text, for the ſtate of the Reſurrection is not the ſtate of ſeparation, or ſeparated ſouls; but the Apoſtle ſpeaks plainly and expreſly of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or peregrination from the body, which is the ſtate of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, during which ſtate, he might (as he ſaith) be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with Chriſt. I do not deny, but that in the precedent and ſubſequent Texts he may ſpeak alſo of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but it does not therefore follow, that he ſpeaks of that ſtate onely: and as for his words, they clearly bear witneſſe to the contrary; therefore after death, and before any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union with the body the ſoul remaineth. And by this clear ſenſe his ſecond ſhift is taken away, whereby he ſeeks to elude a like place of the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23, 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.18. It is ſaid of a woman, that <hi>her ſoul was departing:</hi> therefore there was ſuch a thing as a ſoul that continued after death.</p>
               <p>He anſwers, that the meaning was, <hi>ſhe died.</hi> Be it ſo, yet the words do not import that onely; but beſides, that this dying of hers was by the departing of her ſoul from her body, and not by the periſhing or deſtruction of the ſoul departing. For example, when we ſay, The enemy is departed from ſuch or ſuch a place, we do not mean, he is ſlain, but onely gone, and do intimate that he is ſtill alive. She could not die, ſaith he, if her ſoul were living. This is both falſe and alſo abſurd, for it was not the living of her ſoul which made her live, but the being of it living within her body, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of it with the ſame: as then this preſence and union of a living ſoul made her live, ſo on the contrary ſide, the taking away of this preſence and diſſolving this union muſt

But this is a foppery, for though Chriſts humanity was three nights and dayes in the lower parts of the earth, yet his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity was that day every where; and beſides his ſoul was happy ſtill, and carried its Paradiſe along with it; ſo that the good Thief might be with Chriſt that day, and be in

               </head>
               <p>VVE have ſeen already that, by the conſent of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of all times and nations, the rationall ſoul is not ſubject to corruption, and that it hath not a period of time aſſigned it beyond which it muſt not paſſe; nor that it may ſimply leave to be, and be annihilated as it were by the principles of nature it ſelf, they not requiring any longer conſervation from the beneficence of the firſt cauſe; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe to be deſerted by it, as a late Authour vainly, and without any probability at all, imagined; much according to the old phantaſie of the Stoicks, who, as <hi>Cicero l.</hi> 1. <hi>Tuſc.</hi> not without indignation and ſignes of deriſion, rehearſeth, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuram nobis largiuntur, tanquam cornicibus; diù man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuros aiunt animos, ſemper negant:</hi> 
                  <q>They allow us a date, as they do to Crowes; they grant our ſouls ſhall continue long,</q> but that for ever they deny it: dealing in like manner with Souls, as ſome did with Oracles, whoſe ſilence they aſcribe to no other cauſe than impotency of ſpeaking any longer, the ſpirit that fed them exſpiring of it ſelf, as being waſted and conſumed with age. One would judge, ſaith <hi>Cicero,</hi> theſe men ſpake not of Oracles, but of falſedges, which by long keeping would grow unſavoury and ſtale. Certainly, theſe that judge thus of Souls and ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances make an eſtimate of them, as they would do of trees, whoſe timber is of ſeverall ſolidity and duration: as if ſome of them were like Cedar wood, or Oake, which would laſt long; others as Cheſnut, or Elme, which be not of ſo long continuance; others again like Aſh, or Maple, which rotte within a while. This is light Philoſophy, worthy of deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion more than confutation, and is a device not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by our Authours before alleadged, who give no
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114895:26"/>limitation to the life of ſouls, but determine abſolutely a perpetuity. For my part, before ſuch time as I can aſſent to their Philoſophy in this point, I deſire to be ſatisfied by them what reaſon they can ſhew, why the firſt cauſe ſhould at a certain date of yeares withdraw his preſervative, or conſervative influence, and why the ſame influence is not ſtill as formerly to be continued, or what exigence of nature there is, or may be, which ſhall make the difference. I grant them that in compounded bodies a Philoſophicall reaſon may be given of ſuch an alteration, becauſe it may fall out that the natural impugnation of them by the a gency of ſecond cauſes for their corruption, or diſſolution, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch a revolution of influxe. Alſo the ſame may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for the ſet time of deſition of accidents permanent, then whenſoever they come to be deſerted by the ſubjects which gave them their ſupport; which thing may happen to them, either by the diſſipation of thoſe ſubſtances, or elſe by the violence of ſome external agent that ſhall diſlodge them. In accidents that be fluent, and by nature ſucceſſive, a reaſon alſo may be rendred why they ſhould continually ceaſe to be, and beſides, at a certain terme or period, exſpire for alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But yet, why ſubſtances incompounded &amp; by nature permanent, ſuch as naturally cannot be corrupted, nor periſh by diſſolution, of which ſort all Intelligences be &amp; all other ſubſtances intellectual, as, namely, the rationall ſouls, why they, I ſay, ſhould have a fatall houre aſſigned them, &amp; then require to be annihilated and forſaken by the ſovereigne firſt cauſe, theſe new Philoſophers have not yet told us, much leſſe, why it ſhould be ſo without any requiring on their part, or any naturall exigence for it. Wherefore, leaving theſe light phanſies to the Authours of them, we ſay with the Poet,

               </p>
               <p>Without doubt that ſoul which hath withſtood and ſurvived the violent aſſaults of Death then when it was rent from the body and forced to ſurrender that beloved Fort, there can be no ſuſpicion that it ſhould faile afterwards, grow old with time, decay and come to nothing, and all this without any other force. Beſides, if the ſoul be of a ſimple uncompounded nature, as intellectuall ſubſtances be, then can it not diſſolve, or, which is all one, periſh by corruption. Wherefore if the principles of nature, whereby the ſoul is conſtituted, admit of no deſition nor ending by corruption, there can be no reaſon given why theſe by exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of nature ſhould not require to be continually ſuſtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their being by conſervation from the firſt cauſe, and much leſſe, why at ſuch or ſuch a point of time or age, they ſhould require to be forſaken, and by the withdrawing of the firſt cauſes benevolence, to return unto their firſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Wherefore I account theſe conceits of mortality and aiery poſſibilities of deſition, to be unworthy of any further examination, but rather to be rejected, as inventions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious and ſophiſtick braines, that love to entangle all right threads of diſcourſe, and to obſcure thoſe lights which lead men unto truth.</p>
               <p>Having ſeen all this in favour of an immortality of the ſoul, let us now behold as uniforme and favourable a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the ancient Sages for the divine originall of the ſame, and not humane by procreation, as our impious Authour la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to maintain. <hi>Salluſte,</hi> the Greek Philoſoper, in the place before alleadged out of him, ſpeaks plainly, and tells us it cannot be produced by generation. <hi>Manilius</hi> derives its pedigree from heaven, as we have heard out of him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, which he elſewhere confirmeth, ſaying,

               <p>The Philoſophers of later times are for the major part of them againſt the production of ſouls by procreation; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, <hi>Laevinus Lemnius. l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Occultis nature Miraculis, c.</hi> 11. ſpeaks much after the manner of ſome Heathens before alleadged, calling the ſoul <hi>ſcintillam di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinae mentis;</hi> which is a high expreſſion, yet not meaning (as literally it ſeems) that it is any particle of the Deïty, or any ſubſtance increated, but denoting onely the ſublimity of it, and that the originall is not from the earth. With him agreeth the great ſpeculatour, <hi>Jeannes Argenterius med. ad.</hi> 1. <hi>Aphor. Hippoc.</hi> The famous <hi>Fernelius l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditis rerum cauſis, c.</hi> 5, <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. declaring that the cauſe of all forms in generall is from heaven. <hi>Andrew Laurentius, l.</hi> 1. <hi>Anat. c.</hi> 1. teacheth in expreſſe terms that the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoul is not generated, but created. The ſame doctrine is confirmed by <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus,</hi> one of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous &amp; able Phyſicians of this time, who <hi>tom.</hi> 1. <hi>oper. l.</hi> 5. <hi>Medic. Princ. Hiſtor. hiſt.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 3. doth in this behalf open himſelf very fully, and giveth reaſons alſo why the ſoul can be no other but a ſubſtance indeficient, or immortal. I omit the rehearſall of more votes, and come to enquire
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114895:28"/>after the cauſe why it cannot be generated like other forms.</p>
               <p>In the head of this ſearch I propound the doctrine of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> who <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>Tuſcul.</hi> hath laid the foundation of the truth; <hi>Animorum, inquit, in terris nulla origio inveniri po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>No origine, ſaith he, of ſouls can be found on earth; for in the minde there is nothing that is mixt, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concreate or bred from out the earth, nothing which is humid, or aëriall, or fiery: for in theſe natures there is nothing which hath the power of memory, of minde, or cogitation, which may retaine things paſt, or provide for the future, and comprehend the preſent, which alone be things divine, neither is it ever to be found out how they might betide to man but from God onely; Wherefore the nature and power of the minde is ſingular and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from theſe uſuall and known natures. For which cauſe whatſoever that is which apprehendeth, which is wiſe and willeth, and is vigorous, that ſame is heavenly and divine, and is of neceſſity eternall.</q> So diſcourſed <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> and rightly alſo, if I be not miſtaken.</p>
               <p>The preſſing home of this argument will conſiſt of three points or heads; Firſt, from the nature of the ſoul it ſelf, which ſeems to be an Entity not capable of being produced by generation; Secondly, from the nature of the things out of which it is to be educed; Thirdly, by the inhability of thoſe actions which are exerciſed in generation for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of any ſpirituall ſubſtance, or intellective faculty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſoul in it ſelf were a thing producible, and that the elements might afford ſufficient materialls for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of it.</p>
               <p>For the firſt I argue thus; No entity which is ſimple and unmixt can be produced by generation: but ſuch is the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective part of man: therefore that part is not to be produced by generation; and if ingenerable, then is it incorruptible alſo. That it is ſimple and unmixt, needs no probation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a thing wholly improbable that an intellective
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114895:28"/>power or ſubſtance ſhould be a temperature or mixture, as our Adverſary conceived it to be; for though a temperature and mixture may remotely, or a farre off, concerne under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in as much as they belong unto the Organs, yet is not an intellective Entity therefore a compound or a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily temperature, as by and by we are futher to declare.</p>
               <p>That no ſimple Entity is producible by generation is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe the <hi>effect</hi> or <hi>terminus</hi> of that action is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or compound, which thing it performeth not by producing the Entity of the parts, but by making a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall union between them, and by the making thoſe ſeverall entities to be parts, which although they were before, yet were they not parts of that compounded body which by this newer generation did accrue. Beſides, this is the cleare and expreſſe doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in ſundry places of his works.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond head of probation, I affirme that no lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh matter, or earthly concretion, can yield materialls for the building up of an underſtanding or minde. <hi>Chymiſts</hi> by their curious arts of diſſolving bodies, have found out ſalts, ſulphures, oyles, ſpirits, quinteſſences, elixirs; they again can draw tinctures and magiſteries, and out of metalls, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol which ſhall contain in it the eſſence of them, and have the virtue of tranſmutation of other metalls into their own nature: but yet never any knew how to extract out of them any one dramme of underſtanding, or to fill the leaſt phiall with it; nor could they ever finde metall or oar which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained wit and underſtanding in it. <hi>Arnoldus de villa nova,</hi> as <hi>Mariana</hi> recounteth in his Spaniſh ſtory of Spain, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by mixtures and furnaces, to make a man; but his art failed him, and he was confounded; all his ingredients could not afford him an intellective ſpirit wherewith he might be animated and informed. You will ſay, Senſe cannot be extracted any more than reaſon. True, but ſenſe ariſing from things diviſible may come by a reſultancy from things united, as being materiall, which our reaſon, being imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114895:29"/>cannot, eſpecially in the principall acts thereof, which be wholly inorganicall, as by name the acts of judgement be touching objects immateriall, and <hi>à fortiori,</hi> all ſuch of them as tranſcend the ſpheare of Nature. <hi>Cicero</hi> toucheth chiefely upon this point, and his argumentation ſeemeth to be very ſolid and irreſiſtible, if preſſed to the uttermoſt.</p>
               <p>The third head of argumentation is from the impropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and imbecillity of the actions of humane generation. For firſt, the actions of vegetation and ſenſe are of an inferiour nature, and ſo unable to produce any thing higher and perfecter then themſelves; and for this cauſe each entity is to be produced by actions that be of its own claſſe and order; namely, <hi>per actiones congeneres &amp; cognatas:</hi> therefore the ſoul if it were to be generated, could not be ſo otherwiſe than by actions of underſtanding, or of the intellective; but it is certain, that generation is not performed by acts of wit, or underſtanding, but contrariwiſe by acts of vegetation and ſenſe, which actions be of an inferiour degree; and a man generates with his body, and not with his minde; ſo that the generation of man is no more any act elicite of reaſon, than his eating or walking is, which actions be no acts of the underſtanding, though preſcribed and directed by it. Now though the act of the divine underſtanding be ſubſiſtent, yet the acts of created underſtandings be only accidents; for ſuch and no better is the <hi>verbum mentis</hi> in all created under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, humane or Angelicall, and therefore humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings beget no underſtandings, nor any children like themſelves. It followeth then, that the ſoul neither gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates a ſoul, nor again is generated by any, and for this cauſe muſt be incorruptible, and, by the principles of nature, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall. By this it appeareth that the non-generation or traduction of the ſoul is a verity ſo evident, that by it the immortality may be proved, and it ſtands not in need to be it ſelf proved by immortality. Beſides all this, it is plain that every ſubſtance incorporall, being voyd of compoſition
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114895:29"/>phyſicall, hath no paſſive principles of corruption in it, and therefore is not ſuſceptible of any phyſicall generation, or corruption, nor is reſolvable into parts: and this argument is urged by <hi>Scaliger excercit.</hi> 307. <hi>n.</hi> 20. Again, the ſoul hath no contrariety of qualities within it, nor is there any thing abroad which is contrary thereunto. I know well that many things may ceaſe to be, and yet not by corruption, as for example, ſundry ſorts of accidents, and the ſouls of Beaſts: but yet theſe are conſequents of corruption; for therefore the ſoule, for example, of a Beaſt periſhes, becauſe the organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body which it inhabited was deſtroyed or corrupted; and again, therefore an accident ceaſed to be, becauſe, by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptive action of a contrary agent, it was thruſt out of doors, and had nothing left it whereupon to reſt, no <hi>baſis</hi> to ſuſtein it any longer. And by this the argument of <hi>Petrus Molinaeus l.</hi> 9. <hi>Phyſ. c.</hi> 12. is anſwered, by which he laboured to infringe the ancient doctrine, namely, <hi>That every imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall ſubſtance and incorporeall was incorruptible and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,</hi> and that, conſequently, the ſoul of man being ſuch a ſubſtance, could not be corrupted, or otherwiſe naturally ceaſe to be: of which point ſee <hi>Merat. tom.</hi> 1. <hi>tract. de Ang. diſp.</hi> 9. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. and <hi>Bagotius tom.</hi> 2. <hi>Inſtit. l.</hi> 1. <hi>diſp.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 8. To tell us here, as ſome new maſters do, that a ſpirit may be compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of a certain ſpiritual matter and of a form thereunto cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent, and that therefore every ſpirituall ſubſtance may not be ſimple, but, contrariwiſe, reſolvable into parts eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, according as corporeall ſubſtances be, is to tell dreames and fancies of the night, inſtead of probabilities: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, deſiring them to dream again, and to enjoy their own imaginations, I leave them to their reſt. But howſoever this new device of theirs might have ſome truth in Angels, which are compleat ſubſtances, and abſtracted from corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall materiality, yet in the ſoul of man it could not, becauſe the ſoul it ſelf is a form &amp; a ſubſtance incompleat, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a prodigious thing it muſt needs be to make this forme
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114895:30"/>to conſiſt of both forme and matter, and ſo to compound man of one forme and two matters, one ſpirituall and the other corporeall; yea and indeed, by admitting materiality in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to make them leſſe pure and ſimple then the ſoules of mortall men, which to doe might ſeem to be a device, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, very ſimple. True it is that matter taken in a large ſenſe, that is to ſay, for potentiality, and as contradiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed to a pure actuality, may be admitted in ſpirituall ſubſtances; but yet this makes nothing for the diſſolution of them into parts, or for corruptibility: of which kinde of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriality or compoſition the learned ſchool-Doctour <hi>Thomas de Argentina</hi> hath ſaid enough to ſatisfie, 2. <hi>ſent. d.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 1. Moreover, admit that, properly ſpeaking, a ſpirituall matter were poſſible, becauſe ſome few Doctours be of that opinion, and amongſt the reſt our countrieman M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Thomas Carleton, aliàs Compton,</hi> in his <hi>Philoſophy</hi> lately publiſhed, <hi>diſp.</hi> 9. this opinion of theirs does not take away the force of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; firſt, becauſe we are not to conſider what opinion this or that man does holde, but, contrariwiſe, what he hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hold; ſecondly, becauſe if I hold this ſpirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be a thing implicatory and a fiction, or that my reader do alſo think the ſame, then, according to our judgements at the leaſt, the argument is good and efficacious. Neither is it requiſite that no argument ſhould be produced, or be thought efficacious, ſave onely ſuch as in every Doctours judgement ſhould be accounted ſuch, and to be concluding; becauſe then, perhaps, we ſhould bring none, neither for this ſame verity of immortality, nor yet for any other: wherefore, although peradventure <hi>Scotus</hi> &amp; his ſub-Philoſopher <hi>Pontius,</hi> or <hi>Arriaga</hi> or <hi>Carleton</hi> ſhould not like of this or that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are not therefore to reject it as not concluding, or as a proof that is not probable, or conducing to the deciſion of the point in hand. But of the impoſſibility and improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this compoſition of matter and forme in ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſee more in <hi>Lud. Moeratius tom.</hi> 1. <hi>tract. de Angelis,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114895:30"/>diſp.</hi> 3. For the neglecting therefore of ſhifting anſwers to the arguments uſually brought in the behalf of immortality, the advice of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Carleton</hi> is very prudent, who <hi>diſp.</hi> 10. <hi>de Anima</hi> admoniſheth, ſaying, <q>In my judgement they doe not diſcreetly, who go about to weaken arguments uſed to be brought by Philoſophers and Divines for the ſoul's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; and might more fruitfully for the Chriſtian Common-wealth have imployed themſelves in ſeeking to eſtabliſh this doctrine, which is the foundation of virtue, then in picking quarrells at the arguments; for no reaſon is ſo ſtrong, which by ſome ſhiftings may not be obſcured.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For, indeed, out of that which hath been delivered touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the non-traduction of the ſoul by any ſeminall way or principles of propagation, the deduction of the ſoul's incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibility will be a buſineſſe very plain and eaſie, and this by virtue of a twofold conſequence; the former of which is drawn from the ſoul's not generating, or active generation; the later from the not being generated, or paſſive generation.</p>
               <p>Touching the former it is clear, that whatſoever ſubſtance doth not generate, that ſame is immortall, even by Natures univerſall proviſion and ordination; for as much as in all her workes ſhe affects one kinde of perennity or other, that is to ſay, either a perpetuity of the individuall, by an indeficient ſtability of the natural principles, or elſe at leaſt in the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> by the intervention of generation and corruption: ſo that whereſoever there is no propagation or acts of generation aſſigned for the maintaining a ſecondary immortality in the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> there muſt of neceſſity be granted a primary and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter immortality in the <hi>individuum.</hi> Hence it followeth, that becauſe a man doth not generate with his minde, but with his body, therefore his body is corruptible in it ſelf, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall onely in the <hi>ſpecies;</hi> and again, that his minde or ſoul is immortall in it ſelf and ſubjected no way to corruption, not ſtanding in need of any help or ſupplies from generation.</p>
               <p>Touching the later, it is manifeſt that every entity which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114895:31"/>is not produced by generation is not generable, and therefore not corruptible. That it is not generable we gather hence, becauſe whatſoever entity is by nature generable, every ſuch entity requires, as by a connaturall way, to be produced by generation; as in like manner, every entity that is ſimple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, whenſoever it is produced, to be produced by no other way but creation. By this it follows, that whatſoever is produced, and not by generation, is by Natures laws ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and ſo by conſequence incorruptible and immortall: But the minde or ſoul of man is produced, and not by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: therefore it is an entity incorruptible. That it is not generated, hath been proved before, as alſo that it doth not generate: for a minde or rationall Soul cannot generate nor be generated by any other agent then a rational Soul, nor by any other actions then acts of reaſon &amp; underſtanding; by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> acts ſince it procreates nothing w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is like it ſelf, nor intends to do it, the ſoul is neither generated, nor doth it generate, &amp; therefore, according to the principles of being, and the laws of Nature, muſt be immortal &amp; unſubject to death or deſition, &amp; not be in any poſſibility to be corrupted by the virtue of agents natural.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Sennertus,</hi> being moved by certain difficulties which he could not overcome, was very inclinable to think the Soul is generated, and that the ſeed it ſelf from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is animated with a humane Soul:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sennertus in Hypom.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note> but he together with <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting upon the conſent of Divines unto the contrary, doth with him religiouſly ſubmit, and ſubſcribe <hi>Pareamus,</hi> Let us obey. As for the ſaid difficulties, I do not finde them very urgent, but that they may conveniently be avoided, as we intend to ſhew in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>As for the reaſons themſelves which prove the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity immediately without any dependency upon traduction from parents, or not traduction, they are often &amp; plentifully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, both by Philoſophers &amp; Divines; as namely, by <hi>Javel. l. de indificentia An.</hi> written by him at the earneſt requeſt of

Campanella</hi> in his <hi>Metaph.</hi> very copiouſly.</p>
               <p>This high preeminence in the Soul, of immortality, we trace out chiefly by the operations of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as by ſo many ſteps which lead unto the knowledge thereof, becauſe, according to the rule in Philoſophy, <hi>ſicut ſe habet res ad eſſe, ſic ad operari, &amp; ſicut ad operari, ſic ad eſſe.</hi> By the nature of any thing we may ſearch out the operations, and again, by the operations, the nature. One of the chief operations of the ſoul is the act of underſtanding, by the indication of which we learn it to be immateriall, and again by the being
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114895:32"/>ſo, not to be corruptible or diſſolvable by any naturall agent, or, which is all one, to be immortall. Theſe acts or operations intellectuall do by three wayes prove the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. Firſt, becauſe they ſimply are intellectuall. Secondly, becauſe they terminate upon objects ſpirituall, and are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of them. Thirdly, becauſe they fall even upon materiall objects after a manner immateriall.</p>
               <p>Firſt, according to <hi>Aquin.</hi> 1. <hi>p. q.</hi> 14. <hi>a.</hi> 1. <hi>Valentia, ibid. Raynaud. Nat. Theol. d.</hi> 2. <hi>q.</hi> 2. <hi>a.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; Aquin. l.</hi> 10. <hi>con. Gent. c.</hi> 44. and others, no power or ſubſtance that is not devoid of matter can be intellectuall, nor again, any object directly and immediately intelligible, which is not alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall; the reaſon is, becauſe corporeity or matter dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the power, and confines it to ſingularities. The words of <hi>Petrus de Aquila,</hi> called <hi>Scotellus</hi> 1. <hi>Sent. diſt.</hi> 35. <hi>q.</hi> 1. are very pertinent and theſe; <hi>By how much,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>any thing is freed from matter, by ſo much is it both objectively and alſo actively intelligible, becauſe, according to</hi> Avicenna <hi>and</hi> Ariſtotle, <hi>Immateriality is the cauſe of Intellection. But God is the most remote from matter and therefore is the most of all intellective.</hi> Wherefore, ſince matter and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreity are over-groſſe to admit of intellection, and that the ſoul of man is intellective, it can be neither materiall, nor corporeall, but, contrariwiſe, of nature elevated above mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that is to ſay, ſpirituall and incorruptible.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſoul doth not onely underſtand mean ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but the higheſt and the pureſt of all, that is to ſay, all objects ſpirituall, and God himſelf. I grant to <hi>Aureolus</hi> that the object and the power need not be alike in nature, and therefore it is no formall conſequence, that becauſe the object is ſpirituall, therefore the power muſt be ſo: but yet nevertheleſſe, the materiall conſequence is very good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is wholly neceſſary that the power intellective ſhould be free from all thoſe impediments of underſtanding, whether like or unlike, which are ſituate within the ſphere
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114895:32"/>of the object, or without it; and that moreover, as <hi>Pet. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reolus</hi> 2. <hi>Sent. dist.</hi> 19. himſelf confeſſes, there ought to be ſome reſemblance or proportion between the object and the power, at leaſt, <hi>quoad rationem cognoſcentis &amp; cognoſcibilis:</hi> but between a materiall power and a ſpirituall object there is none; Firſt, becauſe the power is too low and groſs: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe a ſpirituall entity is ſituate without the ſphere or compaſſe of the object; as for example, an Angell is quite without the compaſſe of any eye corporeall, becauſe he is ſuch an object as is not <hi>viſible,</hi> but <hi>intelligible</hi> onely, that is to ſay, perceptible onely by a power that is higher then any ſenſe, and properly intellective, which the eye is not becauſe materiall; and a ſpirit is therefore imperceptible to our ſight, and beyond the lines of the object, becauſe the object of the ſight is colour, figure, magnitude, &amp;c. none of which are in a ſpirit. And though, as <hi>Arriaga</hi> teacheth, in ſome kinde a corporeall agent may act upon a ſpirit; for a body united to a ſoul, as it is in man, according as it is ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſpoſed, may tranſmit ſomething upon the ſoul, cauſe alterations in it, contriſtate, or rejoice it; yet nevertheleſſe can it not do any thing by way of viſion, becauſe the ſoul hath nothing in it wherewith to terminate the ſight, in which caſe it muſt be wholly inviſible, even although it were no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but ſome other kind of entity, as namely a ſound is, which though it partake of materiality, yet is it inviſible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore imperceptible by the eye, though not by another ſenſe. For this cauſe it ſeems improbable that any corporeal eye can be enabled to ſee the Deity by means of any elevation or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation whatſoever, contrary to the opinion of a late learned Grecian, <hi>Leo Allatius l. de conſen, Eccl. Occid. &amp; Orient.</hi> As then one reaſon why an eye corporeall cannot ſee a ſpirit is becauſe the organ of viſion is corporeall, ſo on the other ſide, one reaſon why a ſoul may be ſenſible of a ſpirit is becauſe the ſoul is ſpirituall, and thereby prepared to receive an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from it, and alſo is, conformably to the object,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114895:33"/>a power <hi>intellective,</hi> as the ſame object is <hi>intelligible.</hi> I ſaid before, that a ſound cannot be ſeen; but I add now, that it may be ſeen eaſier then any ſpirit can, becauſe a ſound is material, and therefore one degree nearer to viſibility then a ſpirit, and for this cauſe needing no intellective faculty to apprehend it, as every ſpirit doth: ſo that againſt the eyes ſeeing of a ſpirit there be two impediments, whereas againſt the ſeeing of a ſound there is but one. Out of all this I deduce, that if the Object be ſpirituall, the Faculty perceiving muſt be no leſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſoul doth not entertain materiall objects after a material manner, but contrariwiſe, after a manner immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, for it abſtracts them from the droſs of matter &amp; the groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſingularity. Now it is a certainty that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>numquod<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> recipitur ſecundu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> modum recipientis,</hi> Every thing is received according to the form of the recipient, &amp; not according to the own; wherefore, ſeeing the manner of being is correſpondent to the manner of operation, &amp; ſeeing again that the manner of the ſouls operation, even upon things materiall, is immateriall, therefore the manner of being of it muſt be alſo immateriall. The impreſſion declares the figure of the ſeal. If then the ſouls impreſſion upon material objects be ſpirituall, the ſoul it ſelf is alſo ſpirituall. The underſtanding of a ſpirit ſpiritually might peradventure be aſcribed to the virtue or aptitude of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but the underſtanding after a ſpiritual &amp; refined manner thoſe objects that be groſſe and materiall, cannot be referred to any other thing then to the virtue of the faculty it ſelf.</p>
               <p>By this then it appears, that in an eye corporeall there is a two-fold repugnancy againſt the ſeeing of a ſpirit, viz. one, becauſe the power is materiall, and therefore not intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of any object at all, ſpirituall, or corporeall: the other, becauſe every ſpirituall Entity is without the precincts of the viſive faculty. Wherefore on the contrary ſide, the eye of the minde, by the being in a ſtate able to receive ſome notions of a ſpirit, and to judge it to be an Entity devoid of matter, may, upon a two-fold evidence, be determined to be ſpiritual.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:114895:33"/>
               <p>Thus, by theſe ſeverall wayes, the action of underſtanding in the Soul proves the incorruptibility thereof. The firſt is, by the being preciſely intellective. The ſecond, becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective of ſpirituall entities. The third, becauſe it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands materiall objects immaterially, which act is done by abſtracting; of which act, whether it be confuſed or diſtinct, we are forthwith to conſider more at large.</p>
               <p>The ſecond operation of the underſtanding is the knowing of ſpirituall things by abſtraction from ſingularities, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall objects after a manner immateriall, and by penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the quiddities or eſſences of things; for of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd and hidden entities, unto which our ſenſes can have no acceſſe, the ſoul of man gets ſome intelligence, and attaineth of them notices, though not perfect, intuitive or comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, yet not contemptible or untrue: neither are theſe eſſences temperatures, as <hi>Baſſon</hi> and ſome others fondly and without probability do imagine, as is elſewhere to be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>A third is a reflection upon it ſelf, which acts are above the nature of matter, as <hi>Albertinus, Campanella</hi> in <hi>Phyſ.</hi> and others doe ſuppoſe for certein.</p>
               <p>Againſt abſtraction ſome object, that it is no perfection, but rather an imperfection, that manner of knowledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confuſed. But this objection is inefficacious; for, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the infirmity of humane underſtanding, the force of our underſtanding things abſtractedly is moſt perfect and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and of all other hath the leaſt confuſion in it; though in ſuch underſtandings as be above humane, and are able with one view to comprehend, abſtraction is needleſſe and no perfection. As for humane underſtandings, we finde by experience that the meaner and groſſer they are the leſſe they can abſtract: and indeed abſtraction in the underſtanding is a ſubtle act, and like to extraction in Chymiſtry, which takes the purer parts from the faeculent, and reſolves bodies into their ſeverall native parts, which before did lie confuſed in one heape and mingled together.</p>

               <p>For the preventing of objections, we adde, that there is a great and manifeſt difference betwixt a knowledge confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and an abſtracted, becauſe the former of theſe two is done by making a commixture of the ſuperiour differences with the inferiour, that is to ſay, of the genericall perfections with the ſpecificall and individuall; but the later is done by an intentionall, or intellectuall ſeparation of one from the other, namely, by the conſidering but one, yet knowing more then one, that is to ſay, both the ſuperiour and inferiour: for we do notabſtract from what we know not, but from what we know; ſo that, according to the humane way of underſtanding, this abſtraction is not a confuſed way of knowledge, but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, not an imperfect, but an exquiſite; becauſe by this the underſtanding doth, as it were, anatomize the object, either pitching upon ſeverall formalityes, as they uſe to call them, or elſe upon ſeverall connotations to different ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as the <hi>Nominalls</hi> ſpeak, according to the different vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues conteined in the ſame object. An abſtractive knowledge makes <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> by the drawing off from matter and ſingularity; a confuſed does not ſo, but faſtens upon the inferiour degrees indiſtinctly and in groſſe. As for example, a confuſed view, if it perceive a figure, or a tree, does not diſtinguiſh the particulars, as not whether it be round, or triangular, an <hi>Elme,</hi> or an <hi>Oake;</hi> but an abſtractive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſuppoſes a particular ſenſe of all, for otherwiſe there could be no abſtraction of one from the other. <hi>Campanella</hi> in his <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> and ſome other alſo related by <hi>Carleton, alias Compton,</hi> diſp. 25. would have it that the eye ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts, though but a power materiall, then, namely, when it ſees confuſedly, as when it perceives, for example, a man, but diſcernes not whether he be <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Plato.</hi> This obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is prevented already, becauſe the ſenſe cannot abſtract from what it ſees not in particular, nor yet draw off from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividualls, compleat or incompleat. Againe, the not-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a perfection is not an abſtraction from it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114895:34"/>the eye ſeeing colour and not ſweetneſſe, doth not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract from that ſweetneſſe, as <hi>Campanella</hi> did imagine it to doe.</p>
               <p>A fourth is the eminency of the acts of underſtanding, which argue a principle nobler and higher than any mortall entity. This argument is largely proſecuted by <hi>Leſſius, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> and <hi>Campanella,</hi> and before theſe by <hi>Cicero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A confirmation hereof is, that ſome acts of humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding be <hi>inorganicall.</hi> But <hi>Molinaeus,</hi> in his Summe of Philoſophy lately publiſhed, will not agree to this, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting, that it is contrary unto experience, becauſe, ſaith he, even at that time when the underſtanding doth abſtract moſt, and contemplates objects that be ſpirituall, it makes them, as it were, materiall, aſcribing extenſion both to God and Angels, circumſcribing them in places, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning lines and limits to them. Againe, there is nothing, ſaith he, in the underſtanding which hath not been formerly in the ſenſe. Thus objecteth he.</p>
               <p>Our anſwer is to this <hi>Maxime</hi> of Philoſophie, that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the learned <hi>Thom. de Argentina q.</hi> 3. <hi>Prologi ar.</hi> 4. it is to be underſtood with limitation, namely, that whatſoever is in the underſtanding hath been formerly in the ſenſe ſome way, at leaſt, or other, that is to ſay, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, or mediatly, in it ſelf, or in the cauſe, effect or ſigne. It's true, accidents may enter by themſelves into the ſenſe, &amp; ſo forward into the underſtanding; but ſubſtances, whether materiall or immateriall doe not ſo, nor yet things abſent in time or place, whether they be ſubſtances or not. Actions and events of ages paſt, alſo of people abſent, of verityes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, we know by teſtimonies, as by ſignes, and not by our ſenſes immediatly: we know a future Eclipſe by the cauſe, the ſoul of man by the effects; and ſo alſo doe we know God, namely, by his word and by his works, one, as by a ſigne, the other, as by an effect; neither hath God ever been known unto our ſenſes.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:114895:35"/>
               <p>Secondly, we anſwer, that the ſoul, being in the middle region betwixt pure bodies without ſpirit, and pure ſpirits without body, as on the one ſide it cloathes pure ſpirits with ſome corporeall veſtures, ſo on the other it doth deveſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall objects of their materiality, namely, by conceiving them conformably unto it ſelf, that is to ſay, after a manner abſtracted and immateriall, declaring thereby the ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it's being; for it is as great a ſigne of a ſpirituall. Being to underſtand a matter immaterially, as it is to underſtand a ſpirit that hath no matter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, that although our power <hi>apprehenſive</hi> does attire ſpiritual ſubſtances in formes corporeall by reaſon of the imaginative faculty upon which it borders, yet the <hi>judging and diſcurſive</hi> faculties do not ſo, for theſe two caſt of all figures and reſemblances corporeall, determining An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, for example, to be ſpirits purely, and devoid of all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and corporeity; as alſo, in like ſort, that privations, though apprehended as poſitive entities, yet are not ſo: in ſo much as the ſoul, by meanes of judgement and diſcourſe, goes further then the phantaſy, and findes out truths which the phantaſy could not tell it, &amp; by thus ſurmounting forms corporeall, ſhewes her independency upon the body, and that ſome of her acts be inorganicall. By this, then, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that the apprehenſion of ſpirituall objects under lineaments corporeall is but the firſt enterteinment of them, which though it do argue ſome imperfection in the ſoul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her manner of being, yet not in the being it ſelf. Wherefore, as on the one ſide this imperfect way of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion argues the ſoul to be in a degree inferiour unto An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, or pure Intelligences; ſo on the other ſide the acts of judgement and of diſcourſe, which it doth exerciſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, do ſufficiently evict that it is in a degree ſuperiour to corporeall entities. I exemplify, for declaration ſake. God, when he firſt arrives in our underſtanding by the out-portalls of ſimple apprehenſions, appeares unto us in the habite of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114895:35"/>a body, an Angel in the likeneſſe of a man, Time dreſt up in wings, &amp; in his hands a ſithe and houre-glaſſe, Death like a raw-bon'd ſire armed with a dart, &amp;c. but forthwith <hi>Judgement</hi> and <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> do waite upon them, diſmiſſing <hi>Apprehenſion,</hi> and being thus ſtepped in, deveſt this Time, for example, pull of his ſtrange diſguize, bid him lay down his ſithe, clippe his wings and break his houre-glaſſe, and to appeare in no other likeneſſe but his own, that is to ſay, without colours, or lineaments corporeall; and thus having diſrobed him of his borrowed attire, the ſoul judges of him as he is, and gathers new verities of him by diſcurring. And as the underſtanding proceeds in this one example, ſo it does in others of the ſame nature: &amp; thus the difficulty which <hi>Melinaeus</hi> made hath found out a ſolution.</p>
               <p>A fifth head of probation is from the appetite of man that can be ſatiated with nothing but eternity, the deſire of which is univerſall and infinite. This deſire being generall muſt needs be from Nature, and therefore right, and not a vicious rapacity or greedineſſe, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſeems to make it, and ſo being right cannot be fruſtrate.</p>
               <p>This argument is urged earneſtly by <hi>Alex. Valignanus l. contra Japonios apud Poſſevinum, parte</hi> 1. <hi>Biblioth. l.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>Thomas Carmelita l.</hi> 11. <hi>de ſalute omnium Gentium procur. c.</hi> 12. and by ſundry other learned men: and it ſeems to be very efficacious, becauſe this ſame appetite of perpetuity is very vehement, reſtleſſe and inceſſant, and beſides, univerſall, yea, <hi>Pliny</hi> himſelf acknowledgeth as much. Wherefore, as from the generall and preſſing appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of meat, we do inferre rightly a convenient proviſion of ſuſtenance ordered by nature; ſo in like ſort, from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted longing after a perpetuity, we may inferre no leſſe rightly a proviſion of immortality ordeined for us. One <hi>Pontius,</hi> a late Scotiſt, in his <hi>Philoſophia univerſa ſecundum mentem Scoti,</hi> excepteth againſt this argument and divers others alſo, with whom not being willing to wrangle, we
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114895:36"/>returne him no other anſwer but this, <hi>viz.</hi> that he who is more in love with the determinations of any one Maſter, be he never ſo eminent, then he is with truth, eſpecially in doctrines of concernment, is not an Eagle of the right breed, nor deſerves the name of a Philoſopher. It may be here objected, that if an appetite were a good argument to prove a ſatisfaction, it would prove we ſhould never dye, becauſe againſt death man hath a great and naturall aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I graunt it proves that either we ſhall not dye, or elſe, at leaſt, ſhould not have died, if we had remained in that ſtate of innocency in which <hi>Adam</hi> was created, for death entred into the world onely by ſinne; but this puniſhment of death is not of the ſoul, but of man, and againe, the death of man is no more but a ſeparation of ſoul and body, out of which the death of the ſoul does not follow, but that of the body onely; for although a body cannot live without a ſoul, yet no reaſon can be given why a ſoul cannot live without a body: nay, on the contrary ſide, though we may eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how a ſoul may be annihilated, yet it is a thing hardly intelligible how it ſhould dy. The ſoul is a form aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent as well as an informant, and therefore may well ſubſiſt without an actuall informing.</p>
               <p>It appeares that this appetite is naturall, Firſt, becauſe it is univerſall, and followes the whole ſpecies; Secondly, becauſe it cannot be ſuppreſt from breaking out into actuall and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement longings after immortality; out of which it followes, firſt, that immortality is a thing poſſible, becauſe nature does not incline us to impoſſibilities; ſecondly, that the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is right and rationall, and cannot be erroneous, as <hi>Scotus</hi> did object it might, for, at leaſt in the generalities, the works of nature be the works of a high intelligence; thirdly, that this immortality is not onely poſſible to be obteined, but alſo ſhall be atteined. Neither if this argument from naturall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite be a good one, would it follow thence, as <hi>Abulenſis in c.</hi> 22. <hi>Matth. q.</hi> 224. conceiveth it would, namely, that the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114895:36"/>Reſurrection would be a naturall effect, and might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by reaſon; this, I ſay, doth not follow, becauſe, as <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> teacheth, 4. <hi>d.</hi> 43. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>a.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; lib. de veritate q.</hi> 24. <hi>a.</hi> 10. <hi>ad.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; in ſupplement. q.</hi> 75. <hi>a.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; Ferrarienſis l.</hi> 4. <hi>con. Gen. c.</hi> 79. the inclination of nature and her power be both of one latitude, and therefore, becauſe no naturall efficient is able to reunite a body once ſeparated, nature does not incline unto it, and ſo not unto the reſurrection. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that unto which nature does incline us is onely to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the ſoul with the body, and not to a reſtitution of it after it is once ſeparated from it, in ſo much that, if any longing do remaine ſtill in man to have a body by way of reſurrection, it is but as hote embers, the remnants of an ancient fire. It is then in this caſe, as it is in the deſiring of having all our limbs perpetually entire; for, if by chance any be cut off, as it is not then in the power of nature to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it, ſo is it not in the appetite of nature to have a reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; ſo that, whatſoever appetite for it there is left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, is a falſe and erroneous appetite, and not truly natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: and of ſuch an appetite as this we may truly ſay with <hi>Scotus, Aquilanus</hi> and others of that ſide, that it can be no argument to prove a ſatisfaction for it. But, ſince the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite which we alleadge is none of that ſort, but, contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, truly naturall, this graunt taketh off nothing from the force of our argument drawn from that true appetite. In fine, although whereſoever there appeares a naturall impoſſibility for the performance of any thing, we may rightly from thence inferre that the appetite to it is not naturall; yet it is not neceſſary, as <hi>Tostatus</hi> would have it, that before ſuch time as we can allow any appetite to be naturall, we ought to know the object of that appetite to be poſſible, for it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth if we do not know it to be impoſſible, becauſe this obſtacle being removed, or elſe not put, the appetite may be diſcerned to be naturall by other wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and univerſality of it; and againe, by this ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turality
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114895:37"/>of it we may diſcover it to be alſo rationall, and conſequently the object of it not to be impoſſible: of which points ſee <hi>Valentia</hi> tom. 1.</p>
               <p>As for creatures irrationall, I mean brute beaſts, and other of that degree of life, they do not aime properly at any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity, neither do they love or hate death, or have any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of it. 'Tis true, they love not to be killed, but why is this? not becauſe they ſhunne death, but becauſe they hate and flie paine which is a companion of death, then when it comes by killing and violence: but we do abhorre death under the proper likeneſſe, and do aime directly at a formall perpetuity, and that perpetuity, not of any dull or ſenſeleſſe being, but of a vigorous life and intellectuall. I ſay diſtinctly, of ſuch a life, for, which of us would not be as willing to be quite annihilated, as to be turned into a brute, or into a ſtone, and again, no leſſe unwilling to be a ſtone, then to be totally deſtroyed and blotted out of the book of Nature? in regard that creatures which are not intellectuall do not poſſeſſe or enjoy themſelves, and ſo receive no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by their being made, nor by their being deſtroyed any loſſe: for thoſe that had nothing given them, can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing taken away. In conſideration of this, it is not the book of Nature in which we deſire to be regiſtred, but in the Book of ſuch a Life, perpetuity without it being not eſteemed by us, nor yet ſuch a life without perpetuity.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is no queſtion but that Nature by her giving life &amp; underſtanding to man intended it for his benefit. Now a knowing or intelligent life that muſt have an end by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall death, is no benefit at all, but rather an infelicity; and therefore man by dying payes a large tribute, for the life was lent him, and returnes to Nature more than he received from her, and the intereſt he payes amounts in that caſe to more than the principall; becauſe in one death (come when it will) there is more acerbity included and greater bitterneſſe, than there could be jucundity or content betwixt the largeſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114895:37"/>termes of living, or in the moſt fortunate ſucceſſes that ever were; ſo we may indeed juſtly and properly be ſaid when we die to pay, and to pay alſo with advantage our debt to Nature: wherefore when man dies, if he then be extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, he ſhould not dye in Natures debt, but contrariwiſe Nature ſhould remaine in his, yea and owe him alſo a vaſte ſumme to recompenſe him for being put to live upon thoſe hard conditions of being afterwards to dye, that is, to be thrown down and deſtroyed by her that built him: for what could this be elſe, but to be lifted up on high that his fall might be the greater and more afflictive? Better, ſurely, to lye ſtill, though never ſo low, then to riſe up to fall.</p>
               <p>For what thing more diſcontenting than <hi>fuiſſe aliquande &amp; non eſſe, vixiſſe &amp; non vivere,</hi> to have been ſometimes and not to be any longer, to have had a life or living ſpirit and now not to have any, but to be thrown for ever amongſt the dead, and to be caſt down as low as lumpes of earth or heaps of ſtones? It is commonly received as a truth, that there is nothing ſo afflictive, as once to have been happy and not to be ſo any longer. And indeed if the caſe were ſo with man, that death ſhould devoure him wholly and put an end to all, extinguiſhing both him and his deſires together, the complaint of <hi>Pliny</hi> againſt Natures harſhneſſe might ſeem not to have been made without juſt cauſe, namely, that ſhe is illiberall to man, <hi>Cujus causâ videtur cuncta alia genuiſſe, magna &amp; ſaeva mercede, contra tanta ſua munera; ut non ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ſit aestimare parens melior homini an tristior noverca fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> that is, upon ſuch hard conditions, that it were not eaſie to determine whether ſhe had ſhewed her ſelf towards him like an indulgent mother, or a cruell ſtepdame. So he, <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>in Proem.</hi> and rightly, ſuppoſing, as he falſely did, the ſoul of man to be mortall, foraſmuch as out of that erroneous conceit this abſurdity or rather impiety muſt follow, <q>
                     <hi>Turpiùs ejicitur quàm non admittitur hoſpes.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For what is the benefit of an ending life? Is it not to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114895:38"/>taſte of light and living that you might feel the grief of looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, which otherwiſe you would not have done; and to be ſhewed &amp; made infinitely enamoured of a felicity which you are never to enjoy, but to be barred of for ever?</p>
               <p>Again, if man by death ſhould be utterly deſtroyed, what did it avail him to have lived? were his eyes, think we, given him, that with them he might have a ſight of death, how ill he likes him, or how grimly and unpleaſantly he looks? ſhall all his education and labours taken in the world ſerve for nothing but, at the end, to marry him to rottenneſs, and for wormes to be his ſiſters everlaſtingly? A fair prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the cloſe of all, and a worſhipfull kindred! We cannot dive into the counſels of the Almighty, but yet, by his other mercies and perfections, we may gather that he is too good, too bountifull to ſet down ſo hard an order for us, or to have been ſo ſparing of his gifts. What? ſhall any man think that we all were ſent into the world upon a frivolous errand, that is to ſay, to come in hither onely to goe out again, and ſo to be as very nothings at the laſt end as we were at the firſt entrance?</p>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>That death ſhould make us neither leſſe nor more,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>But merely nothing, as we were before?</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
               <p>Or were we ſent hither by a power ſuperiour, onely to make ſport for the lookers on, ſuch bitter ſport as the Cat makes with the Mouſe, much to her ſorrow while it laſts, &amp; when it ends, then to no leſſe then her deſtruction? Such bits as theſe, unworthy of God, unworthy of man, muſt they ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low down who will maintain the ſoul's mortality. The whole deſire of mans heart, as it is either to be happy, or elſe not to be at all, ſo is it either to have this happineſſe perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually, or elſe to have it never given him. <hi>Tully</hi> in the end of his Dialogue entituled <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> although he takes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great comfort from the conſideration of the ſoul's immortality, yet nevertheleſſe, to the end he might make all ſure in caſe it ſhould not be ſo, he addeth, ſaying, <q>But
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:114895:38"/>if that wherewith we are ſenſible and do underſtand, be mortall and ruinous, this extinguiſhment and ſetting of it cannot but be pleaſant to him who hath diſcharged aright the offices of humane life; and may, without being moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at all, be embraced by him as a repoſe or quiet of his life.</q> Thus pleadeth <hi>Cicero,</hi> with whoſe reſolution S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> remaineth much unſatisfied, wondring juſtly how a man of ſo great with as he, and who places humane felicity in the contemplation of the truth, could promiſe a pleaſant good-night or ſet of that intellectual ſubſtance, whereupon all this felicity of his is founded; as if, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that thing did dy which we did not love, or rather, which we ſo deadly hated, as in the deſtruction of it we ſhould rejoyce. Thus ſtrongly argueth S. <hi>Auguſtine l.</hi> 14. <hi>de Trinit. c.</hi> 19. Surely, if we love our own ſoul and our felicity, we cannot rejoice or take any contentment in the extinction and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of either, but rather on the contrary ſide be incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly afflicted with it, and the ſole remembrance of it cannot but be unpleaſant, and cauſe a moſt vehement contriſtation in the heart of man, and finally, let <hi>Epicurus</hi> ſay what he will, ſtrike ſuch a damp into his pleaſures, as would be of power ſufficient to extinguiſh them.</p>
               <p>I know well that God may do with his creatures what he pleaſes; his juriſdiction over them is illimited by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing then by his own juſtice and mercy. <hi>Job</hi> in his affliction confeſſed this, when he taught us, <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Who is it can ſay, why doſt thou ſo?</hi> and by and by after, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>In a whirlewinde he will cruſh me, and multiply my wounds, even without a cauſe.</hi> What he can do we do not enquire, but what he will do, or hath done, we may give a gueſſe by his other mercies towards us. If things ſhould thus go with man, we might reſemble his ſtate to a Gueſt that ſhould be entertained for one night with all the dainties, the welcome and delight that might be, and the very next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row be ſent to the gallowes, there to make a concluſion of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114895:39"/>his joyes and welcome. In fine, whatſoever is not perpetuall is nothing, and mans heart cannot receive true content from any thing which he is to looſe, and whoſe poſſeſſion is without date immortall. <hi>Non eſt mortale quod opto,</hi> Our hearts aſpire not after any thing which is mortall; neither when we have conſidered well do we ſay within our ſelves, <hi>Aut Caeſar, aut nihil;</hi> but, <hi>Aut aeternum, aut nihil:</hi> Not to be <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or nothing; but to be eternal, or not at all. For as <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Antoninus in l. de vita ſua</hi> rightly ponders, &amp; like a man of wiſdome after death is once come <hi>quid habet ille qui vixit tribus ſeculis plus illo qui vixit triduó?</hi> what hath that man who lived three ages left him more than any other that lived but three ſingle dayes.</p>
               <p>This argument though it prove another life after this, yet doth it not directly evict there ſhall be no interruption of living in the ſoul untill the reſurrection; nevertheleſs it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades it ſtrongly, becauſe the faireſt way of perpetuity is by continuing it in the ſoul, and by the leaving there a pledg for a totall accompliſhment to follow after, and the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this dying of the ſoul is an improbable invention, &amp; ſuch as in Philoſophy or Divinity hath no foundation, but rather indeed is a great ſtep to infidelity; for if men have much adoe to perſwade themſelves that after the body is dead and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it ſhall have the aſhes gathered together and riſe again, they would finde much more difficulty if they ſhould think that the ſoul it ſelf was mortall and to be extinguiſh'd, and ſo in the whole man nothing left of life.</p>
               <p>A ſixth probation is from the abſoluteneſſe and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of humane will, which matter is well followed by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reolus in</hi> 2. <hi>ſent. dist.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>A ſeventh is drawn from the benignity and juſtice of God in favouring the good, and giving recompenſe for all their labours and ſorrows in this life; which recompenſe ſince it is not given in this life, it muſt be in another, and ſo there muſt be another life. I confeſſe alſo that this argument,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114895:39"/>though it prove a ſecond life, yet doth it not exclude an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of living in the ſoul more then it doth in the body; for at the reſurrection a compleat recompenſe may be made both to ſoul and body, notwithſtanding they both had been extinguiſh'd for a time: but yet becauſe this fancy of the ſouls being extinguiſh'd is not proved by any one argument which is conſiderable, therefore that ſame <hi>medium</hi> which proves a ſecond life after the departure from the body, proves alſo a continuance of the ſecond with the firſt; for no Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher or Divine of note hath hitherto been found ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vord of ſenſe, as to dream of any interruption of living in the ſoul, but that if it was to live after death, it was to do it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, or if it died, then it was to live no more for all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. So that this mans reviving of ſouls is an errour as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and improbable, as his reſurrection of beaſts, which is the expreſſe doctrine not of Chriſt the great and true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, but of the grand Impoſtour and falſe Prophet <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> both in his <hi>Alcoran</hi> and the books of <hi>Sonna,</hi> as <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dionolus</hi> reciteth out of him in his Book againſt <hi>Achmet Ben Zin</hi> a <hi>Perſian Mahumetan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some labour to evade this argument by ſaying that no ſuch recompenſe is neceſſary in another life, becauſe a full a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends is made in this. If you ask them how, they tell you that <hi>Virtus divitiis animoſa ſuis, nec indiga laudis est prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium ſibi;</hi> Virtue is rich, and is a reward unto her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>This ſaying is nothing but a Stoïcall tumour or ſwelling which hath no ſolidity in it; for firſt, ſay it were a reward, yet not rightly diſtributed or dilated; for how ſmall a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mortall men are ſenſible of this aiëry reward? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, mans reward is his felicity, and therefore muſt be both great and perpetuall: but this ſame reward is a very ſlender one &amp; beſides the ſlenderneſſe it is of ſmall duration; out of which it follows that this contentment received from virtue is no ſufficient recompenſe, nor reduceth things unto equality, nor laſtly, commends or juſtifies the providence of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114895:40"/>God. Thirdly, this contentment received in the ſoul from virtue cannot keep the virtuous from being miſerable, becauſe this ſolace is received onely in the minde or ſoul, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which content, he may be in poverty, captivity, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in <hi>Perillus</hi> his Bull, or upon the rack; in which caſes, as the body ſuffering for a good cauſe receives contentment from the ſoul, ſo in like ſort the ſorrows be reciprocall, for the ſoul is made partaker of the miſeries of the body, and is afflicted by means of it; ſo that in fine here is no full and clear contentment, but a mixture of joy and ſorrow, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently here is no deſired reward or felicity, neither of ſoul nor body, and much leſſe of the whole man, who conſiſts eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially of both, and is totally to be rewarded, and not the one half of him alone, whether ſoul or body. <hi>Num,</hi> ſaith <hi>Anaſtaſius Sinaïta, quaest.</hi> 73. <hi>quando oportebat certare, corpus plus ſudoris expreſsit, quando autem est tempus coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum, ſola coronatur anima?</hi> Shall the body endure the greateſt trouble in the conflict, and the ſoul alone receive the crown or comfort? this were no juſtice or equity. Certainly a man in this ſtate would ſtand in need of patience, which virtue I think was never neceſſary for the happy man, but for the afflicted, nor for the enjoying of felicity, but the enduring of miſery. In ſumme, it were a fury to think that while theſe two parts of man, body and ſoul, are linked together, that one half of him can be happy while the other is miſerable, or that the reward of the ſoul alone is the reward of the whole man, and able to give him ſatisfaction: But that, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, as the ſoul of man is but one half of him, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed much the better half, ſo likewiſe the felicity of the ſoul alone is but one half of mans felicity; and ſo again, the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his body one half of his infelicity, though by much the leſſer. See of this point <hi>Abulenſis in c.</hi> 4. <hi>Deut. q.</hi> 7. <hi>Thomas de Argentina in</hi> 4 <hi>diſt.</hi> 49. <hi>art.</hi> 4. <hi>Vincentius Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luacenſis l. de Conſolat. ad Regem Ludov. c.</hi> 11. alſo our countrey-man <hi>Jo.

So that albeit reaſon alone without revelation cannot prove the reſurrection to be, becauſe this effect exceeds the virtue of naturall cauſes, there being allowed in nature no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs <hi>à privatione ad habitu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;</hi> yet reaſon proves that article to be very convenient &amp; credible for an accompliſhment of all, &amp; without which there is no way remaining, either for the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying of providence, or the rewarding &amp; beautifying of man, or laſtly, for the giving any life and encouragement to virtue.</p>
               <p>Now if a reward over and above the inward contentment of the minde be due to virtue, and this reward is to be of the whole man, and alſo to be paid him after this life, then muſt this reward be ſuch as will fully ſatisfie and content him, for ſatisfied he is to be, and alſo ſatisfied by that which is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conſequent to his actions, wherefore his contentment muſt be eternall; for nothing elſe can pleaſe him, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where we have endeavoured to evict, and as, I ſuppoſe, every mans own heart will tell him without book: wherefore the ſoul, which is to enjoy this, muſt alſo be eternall, or, which in our ſenſe is all one, immortall. <hi>Pontius</hi> the Scotiſt ſtruggles againſt this argument alſo for the defence of his Maſter <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> but the zeal of defending truth and of delivering health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full doctrine, I value above that other of defending the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of any one particular Maſter whatſoever, if he be but a man, as <hi>Scotus</hi> was no more.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, the doctrine of the ſoul's immortality is the foundation of virtue, without which ſhe muſt needs fall unto the ground: this is clearly ſhewed by <hi>Leſſius,</hi> and long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him by the Platonick and Heathen Philoſopher <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles;</hi> 
                  <q>Unleſſe, ſaith he, ſomething ſhould ſubſiſt in us
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114895:41"/>after death fit to be adorned with verity and virtue, which ſubſiſtent thing without doubt is no other than the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoul, we ſhould have no pure deſire of honeſty or virtue. For the ſuſpicion of an aboliſhment would choak the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites of theſe, and divert us to corporeall pleaſures, of what ſort ſoever, or whenſoever they might be gotten by us. And according to that doctrine, how could it ſeem the part of a prudent or moderate man not to be ſo indulgent to his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as to grant it all things, ſeeing the ſoul in that caſe was preſerved for the bodies ſake, and of it ſelf had no exiſtence, but accrued unto man from the conformation of his body? Or why under the name of virtue ſhould we mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt our body, if the ſoul ſo periſh with it, as virtue her ſelf can have no ſubſiſtence left, for whoſe ſake we endure death?</q> Thus farre <hi>Hierocles,</hi> and that very cordially and truly.</p>
               <p>If then the doctrine of the ſoul's immortality be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of virtue, doubtleſſe it is a truth aſſured, becauſe virtue and a rationall manner of converſation, taken in the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cannot be founded upon any falſehood or uncertainty, as <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> hath notably declared.</p>
               <p>I might add here the arguments of <hi>Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 308. <hi>n.</hi> 20. of <hi>Aureolus Renatus des Cartes,</hi> and divers others, but theſe alone well explicated and conſidered are ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the chief ſeats of arguments, from whence Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours do uſually fetch them, which how much more or leſſe valid or perſpicuous they may ſeem, yet have they been held for good by the wiſeſt Philoſophers both Heathen and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and to be concluding. But howſoever that be, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it ſelf hath been counted certain and evident, inſomuch as <hi>Aureolus</hi> himſelf, although he found difficulty in ſundry of the arguments, yet did he not doubt to ſay, ſpeaking of the ſoul's immortality, in 2 <hi>Sent. diſt.</hi> 19. <q>This doctrine of faith is to be held undoubtedly, and it is the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the minde, and a verity evident of it ſelf, though to give a reaſon for it, it is not ſo caſie.</q> So <hi>Aureolus,</hi> with
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114895:41"/>whom conſenteth <hi>Cicero,</hi> when as he ſaid, as hath been before alleadged out of him, that it is the conſent of all nations. <q>Now, ſaith he, if the conſent of all be the voice and verdict of Nature, then are we to think the ſame.</q> Beſides, how could ſo many Heathen Philoſophers have acknowledged unanimouſly this doctrine of immortality, otherwiſe then by the light of nature and common reaſon? out of which it is plain, that naturall reaſon doth teach us this verity. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth then, that by <hi>Ciceroes</hi> judgement, whatſoever the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments be, the doctrine it ſelf is not onely true, but alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and evident; which thing may very well be, for there be many truths which are not proved eaſily or evidently, and yet nevertheleſſe be very certain, yea peradventure are not to be proved at all, but be things moſt evident and indemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable; nature and the underſtanding acknowledging and embracing them as legitimate, without any further argument than her own light: and again, many things be knownly falſe which nature rejecteth as ſpurious and falſe, although ſhe be not able to demonſtrate that they involve any repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy or contradiction; ſo that indivers verities we are to rely laſtly upon <hi>Tertullian's Teſtimonium animae,</hi> without exacting from them any clearer evidence.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>A Liſt of ſome other Topicks, or heads of probation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A Ninth head of argumentation is taken from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe of Religion which is in the ſoul of man, and in no other of creatures inferiour, by reaſon of which ſenſe he is eaſily induced to make an humble acknowledgement of an inviſible and ſupreme Power, unto which all things are ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, &amp; all intelligent natures do owe a duty: upon which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection <hi>Seneca</hi> making a reflection pronounceth, ſaying, <hi>Hoc habuit argumentum divinitatis ſuae, quod illum divina dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctant; This argument hath he of his own divineneſſe, that he is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114895:42"/>delighted with things divine.</hi> Thus he, and not without good reaſon for it, in regard that creatures endued with ſenſe have their delights ſutable unto their beings, or natures: wherefore as the natures be, ſo are the delights; if terreſtriall and fading, ſuch are the natures; if contrariwiſe celeſtiall and ſempiternall, the natures are thereafter.</p>
               <p>From this feeling of Religion came it to paſſe that, throughout the whole civiliz'd world, ſo many Temples were erected, ſo many Altars, religious houſes, ſolemnities and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivalls, whether in particular holy or ſuperſtitious, ſacred or profane, right or wrong, according to the different paſſions and apprehenſions of men, yet all of them conſpiring in this one, that the Deity was with all humble recognizance and ſubmiſſion to be worſhipped.</p>
               <p>A tenth Topick may be the eminent deſire of chaſtity and ſingle life, a quality tranſcending the condition of any nature wholly ſubject to corruption. For the better concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of which verity, we are to note that Nature in all her compleated works aſpires unto a perpetuity, and therefore doth not onely furniſh them with means for the effecting of it, but alſo impoſes a neceſſity upon them for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſuch as they are not able to reſiſt. I ſay, a <hi>perpetuity,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Individuum,</hi> or elſe in the <hi>Species</hi> at the leaſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible things are neither produced by generation, nor yet do generate, neither have they any appetite thereunto. As for example, Angels and the Orbes celeſtiall. Thoſe other who are allowed no better an immortality then ſpecificall, or by ſucceſſion from one of the ſame kinde unto another, Nature hath not onely made apt to generation and able, but alſo ſo prone unto it as it cannot be reſiſted by them. The condition of man is neither exempted from generation, as Angels be, and from the appetite thereof, nor yet ſubjected to it by any naturall enforcement, as brute beaſts, but is of a middle temper, partaking of both extreams: he can generate, and hath an appetite to it, neither of which two qualities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114895:42"/>to Angels; again, he hath an appetite alſo to live chaſte, and can refrain, neither of which two properties belong to Beaſts. So that, as with the creatures below him he hath an inclination to propagate; ſo alſo with incorporeall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which are above him, he can controll and bridle that ſame appetite, and alſo make it wholly ſubject to the other, he aſpiring unto a fairer and better way of continuance and perpetuity then ſpecificall. By this, then, it appeares that in man there is ſomething which is mortall, and again, that there is alſo ſomething which is immortall, and ſtands in no need to be repaired by generation; and what can this be but his ſoul? The practiſe of the world confirms that which we have ſaid, becauſe the virtue of chaſtity hath ſtill been held in no ſmall reputation and eſteem, as for example, amongſt the Jews, in the <hi>Eſſeni,</hi> of whoſe inſtitute of life, large and honourable memories are exſtant in <hi>Joſephus, Pliny, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus;</hi> amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the <hi>Veſtall Virgins;</hi> amongſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> in the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts;</hi> amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in the great <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus,</hi> of whoſe acts <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> and others do make ample mention.</p>
               <p>An eleventh argument may be drawn from our ſolicitous inquiries touching our ſoul's perpetuity, as of a matter of high concernment and by no means to be neglected, Nature her ſelf thereby teaching us that we had claim unto it. This argument is in the firſt place produced by a late Rabbine of <hi>Amſterdam, Menaſſeh Ben Iſrael, de Reſurrect. c.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>A twelfth way of probation is from the conſent of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who all of them doe, either expreſsly a vow this opinion of immortality, or elſe teach it implicitly in ſome practiſe or other in which it is involved, and to be ſuppoſed as a truth. Of the Nations in particular I need not render an account, both becauſe the matter is well known, and alſo becauſe the ſame Rabbine <hi>Ben Iſrael l. de Reſurr. c.</hi> 9. <hi>Eugubinus l. de Perenni Philoſophia, Gaſſendus tom.</hi> 1. <hi>de Philoſophia Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> have done it exactly.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:114895:43"/>
               <p>This conſent being generall, and no erratick or ſtragling imagination, cannot but have a foundation that is ſolid. <hi>That act,</hi> ſaith <hi>Thom. de Argentina l.</hi> 1. <hi>d.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 2. <hi>con.</hi> 1. <hi>which doth follow the whole ſpecies is ſimply &amp; abſolutely naturall; and again, that is neceſſary which amongſt all is one &amp; the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our thirteenth and laſt way of probation is from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and undeniable apparitions of ſouls departed; the truth of which we have atteſted and delivered unto us by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, as creditable and authenticall as we are wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for the confirmation and aſſurance of other things which are to come unto our knowledge by relation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the argument drawn from hence cannot but be ſolid and good, and therefore if we give credit unto thoſe other rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we cannot in any reaſon deny it unto theſe. To tell us here of <hi>Legends</hi> were a vanity, for all <hi>Legends</hi> are not lying, though ſome be, no more then all other Hiſtories are lying, though divers of them be. It were a bold act to give thely to the <hi>Annalls</hi> of <hi>Baronius</hi> and of his learned continuatour <hi>Odoricus Raynaldus,</hi> to the <hi>Annalis</hi> of the <hi>Minorites</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed exactly by <hi>Lucas Wadding,</hi> or to the noble Hiſtory of <hi>Ferdinandus à Caſtello,</hi> to the <hi>Florilegium</hi> of <hi>Ribadeneyra,</hi> to <hi>Matthew Paris, Guilelmus Nubrigenſis, Bartholomaeus Sibylla, Alph. Toſtatus, Euſtratius apud Photiums, Beda, Nauclerus, Caeſarius, Cantipratenſis, Guil. Tyrius,</hi> and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite others, who all agree in this point, and whoſe authority is ſo great, as it will retort the ly upon the reprehender with greater force then it can be caſt upon them by him or any man</p>
               <p>Now although it be a thing not evident, that the ſpirits ſeeming to appear are really the ſouls of ſuch or ſuch deceaſed perſons, yet have we no reaſon to think otherwiſe: but if that they are their good or evill Angells, which, by divine appointment, do act in their behalf and likeneſſe, yet even by that it will appear that thoſe ſouls are ſtill alive; for God himſelf did often appear by ſuch deputies, and manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>Moyſes</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> by the apparition of his Angels.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:114895:43"/>But yet it is a thing no leſſe reaſonable to judge that they are humane ſpirits that make an apparition in themſelves, or at the leaſt in their deputies, then to judge that they are ſpirits. Wherefore whoſo queſtions whether theſe appearing ſpirits be ſouls or no, but rather deluding Devils putting on their likeneſſe, may as well doubt whether, on the contrary ſide, thoſe ſame Devils be really Devils, and not the ſouls of men; or again, whether thoſe living men whom our eyes dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do behold, be really men, or rather, not ſome deluſive appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions. I would fain learn why men, contrary to the doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> &amp; <hi>Epicurus,</hi> ſhould diſtruſt their ſenſes in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing to be the ſame it ſeems, unleſſe they ſee ſome urgent reaſon to the contrary. Surely, in behalf of ſuch appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there may be juſt reaſons given; becauſe it is not unlikely that ſouls which had ſo much dealing in the world during the time of their habitation in the body, and contracted ſo many obligations of juſtice, might after death have ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining here for them to rectifie, and to give notice of unto the living whom it doth concern. Beſides, ſay that they who appeared were Devils, and not ſouls, yet this alone would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue immortality, for, to Doggs and Horſes or ſuch like, who have no relation to a future life, neither Devils nor ſouls doe appear, neither were it to any purpoſe that they ſhould.</p>
               <p>I add, that if no returnes of ſouls were to be admitted, but that being once gone from hence, they were never to be heard of more, many men would be afraid that indeed our ſoules were nothing but a breath, or a ſlender exhalation, which after it was once diſſipated was never again to be drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and conſequently that all the reaſons brought for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality were but ſophiſticall, and found out to flatter us in that opinion; for ſo indeed it fell out with <hi>Epicurean</hi> and wicked men, who pleaſed themſelves with <hi>No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt agnitus qui ſit reverſus ab inferis, There was never any known to have returned from the Dead;</hi> which is as much as to ſay, There were never any Ghoſts, or ſouls of men, that did appear unto the living after death.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:114895:44"/>
               <p>In the firſt Edition of this ſmall Tract, this argument of Apparitions brought up the rear; but it pleaſed the Cenſurer of it in <hi>Oxford</hi> to daſh it quite out, though for what reaſon I do not know. If it were becauſe he counted all the narrations of apparitions to be fabulous, he muſt give us leave to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre before him ſo many faithfull witneſſes who have avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. Again, although he eſteemed them fabulous, yet, ſeeing all men of judgement did not ſo, he might have left the argument to go as farre as it might, and every reader to cenſure of it as he ſhould ſee cauſe, and not thus to impoſe laws upon other mens underſtandings, and preſume to put down his judgement as a rule to others. But contrariwiſe, if he ſcraped out this argument for fear ſuch ſtories of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions might lead the way to ſome doctrines which he himſelf was not willing to admit, this his way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding (I muſt tell him) ſeems to me to reliſh more of craft then ingenuity, and alſo to be ſo farre from reaſonable, as he who uſes it may juſtly be compared to him who, after a prepoſterous manner, would deny the Premiſes, therefore onely becauſe he did not like the Concluſion; or to an evil Aſtronomer, who will not frame his <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> according to his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or celeſtiall apparences, but contrariwiſe, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his apparences according to his <hi>Hypotheſes.</hi> Wherefore our Cenſurer, by this courſe of his, ſeemed deſirous to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what he did hold already to be true or falſe, rather then to correct his errours, and to take right information for beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the truth. We do acknowledge that the Law, the Prophets, and the Goſpell well underſtood are ſufficient to inſtruct us; and again, that for our ordinary intelligence and concernments, we are not to expect meſſengers from the dead: yet this will not inforce us to diſcredit all the teſtimonies of apparitions which time hath left us, or to ſay that in all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions they are fruitleſſe; for, as <hi>Toſtatus</hi> reaſoneth, although they would do no good upon the kindred of <hi>Dives,</hi> which, as it ſeems, was hard-hearted, yet they might upon others;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114895:44"/>and again, although they did not conferre to any living mans converſion and ſalvation, yet they might rectifie ſome injuſtices and errours committed by the dead; and this, for the moſt part, is the errand for which they pretend to come, as <hi>Tyraeus</hi> and other writers teach us: and of this <hi>Toſtatus q.</hi> 89. <hi>in c.</hi> 16. <hi>Matth.</hi> and <hi>q.</hi> 54. <hi>in c.</hi> 17. recites an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample happening in his own time, and alſo teaches, that at the transfiguration the ſoul of <hi>Moyſes</hi> appeared upon mount <hi>Tabor.</hi>

               <p>HAving examined our Adverſaries chief arguments brought by him for proving the ſoul's dying and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, it remains that we take into conſideration another errour, one of no ſmall affinity with this, yea, and in effect all one with it, namely, the ſleeping of ſoules, and their being in a ſtate inſenſible, from the firſt inſtant of their ſeparation from their bodies, untill the generall reſurrection. Such as maintain this errour, not daring, as <hi>Zanchius l.</hi> 2. <hi>de oper. creat. c.</hi> 8. notech, openly to deny the immortality of mens ſouls, becauſe it ſeemed over plainly contradictory to the holy Scripture, and to the judgements alſo of the graveſt and wifeſt Philoſophers and Divines, do therefore deprive them of all ſenſe, knowledge, or any other vitall operation, and lay them to ſleep untill the judgement day in which they are to be reunited to their bodies, which time is to be the firſt of their awaking. But, indeed, if this tenet of theirs be viewed diligently, we ſhall finde that this pretended ſleep is nothing elſe but a direct death, and onely different in the name: and the reaſon is, becauſe for a ſpirit to be deſtitute of all vitall and intellectuall operation, is nothing elſe but to be dead, ſeeing that life is nothing elſe in the ſoul beſides the perpetuall

Wherefore in conſideration and acknowledgement of this inceſſant activity, <hi>Cicero</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers delivered that the ſouls of men were made of fire cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall and unextinguible, borrowed from the ſtarres, and the Poets, in relation alſo to this, did feign that <hi>Prometheus</hi> ſtole fire from heaven, wherewith he gave life to his men of clay, which he had made. Now fire, as we know, is an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alwayes in action, yea, even then when it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked up in aſhes, for even then it works both upon the food that maintains it, and alſo on the adjoyning bodies. Wherefore no charm, no medicine ſoporiferous can caſt the ſpirit of man into ſuch a dull and deadly heavineſſe, as it ſhall not ſo much as have a feeling of it ſelf, nor be awaked by any other voice then that of the laſt trumpet, which ſhall with a dreadful found call all to judgement, and which noiſe ſhall be heard even by bodies, then which there is nothing more dead, or more corrupted, nothing farther off from life, as having the atomes of which they were compoſed, now all diſordered and ſcattered with the wind; and therefore that ſoul which can be rouzed up by a voice no lower, muſt needs be more then a ſleep, or laid down to reſt.</p>
               <p>Sleep is a thing different from Death, though nearly allied unto it, as <hi>Seneca</hi> doth ſignifie in the <hi>Proſopopeia</hi> following;

                  <hi>Conſanguineus Lethi Sopor,</hi> ſaith another, Sleep is Death's kinſman, but how near, we will not examine, and yet ſo near we are ſure, as to a ſpirituall or intellectuall ſubſtance they are both one, and one of them as deſtructive of life in it as the other: becauſe, though they in themſelves be things diſtinct, yet ſleep is as deadly to the ſoul as death it ſelf is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:114895:45"/>to the body, and can agree as little with it; becauſe, though ſenſe can reſt from action, yet reaſon cannot, in regard there is a greater and a more eminent kinde of vivacity in the one then in the other.</p>
               <p>If the Authours of this phantaſie would be underſtood, let them declare, firſt, what kinde of <hi>Entity</hi> they take a ſpirit to be; ſecondly, ſeeing a ſpirit hath no body to reſt, nor ſenſes to ſhut up, nor vitall or animall ſpirits to repair, what this ſleep of a ſpirit is, I mean, how they will define it. If they cannot do this, then are they bunglers, and ſpeak they know not what, and therefore not regardable. If they ſay, it is a ceſſation from action, and from poſſibility immediate of action, then hath a ſpirit no life left in it more then a ſtone or a dead body, and ſo in this caſe to ſleep and to dy ſignify the ſame thing, though in terms that are different.</p>
               <p>Yet ſay that they indeed could tell us what kind of thing this ſleep ſhould be, that ſame is not enough, unleſſe beſides they do prove it ſtrongly, for ſuch extravagancies as this is, are not to be admitted without convincing arguments to make them good. Let us hear then what their arguments be, and let us conſider alſo of what weight.</p>

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.14.37.10. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 21.15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Thren.</hi> 5.6.</note> and being dead, do neither live actually, nor underſtand, &amp;c. And though the ſpirits of men return to him that gave them, as ſhall be demonſtrated elſewhere;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:114895:46"/>yet that thoſe ſame ſpirits be perſons which do any thing, or be ſenſible, or do now enjoy pleaſures everlaſting, is a thing ſo farre off from being taught us by the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as on the contrary ſide, it is eaſily ſhewed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to them, and that alſo by reaſons very evident. For <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth that if the reſurrection of the dead were not to be hoped for, a vain thing it were to think of piety, or for the Truth's ſake to undergo ſo manifold ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and that of all men the Chriſtians would be the moſt miſerable. Which aſſertion of his could not be true, of the ſouls of men without the reſurrection were ſetled in ſuch pleaſures and authority, as that they did not onely enjoy a good eternall, but were alſo in a ſtate to give aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance unto others: becauſe that ſame felicity of theirs would be ſo great, as ſcarcely no acceſſion might be made unto it by the reſurrection.</q> Thus reaſoneth <hi>Volkelius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My anſwer to the firſt part is, by denying it to be ſaid in Scripture ſimply and abſolutely, that ſouls departed, or men departed have no Being at all, but onely, that they have no being upon the earth; in regard that by dying they ceaſe, not only to be men any longer of this world, but even to be men, as before death they had been: and this muſt needs be the true meaning of the places quoted by the Adverſary, in the Margin, and not that other which he pretendeth; becauſe it is a thing moſt evident, both in reaſon and in holy Scripture alſo, that the parts of which men are compoſed be not anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated by death, without any remnant of Being left them but, that they ceaſe onely to be united, or to be men; in reſpect of which deficiency alone it might be truely affirmed of men, as it is in Scripture, that after death they are not in being.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond part I ſay, that although the ſoul after ſeparation from the body, be not a perſon humane, or an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity compleat, yet ſtill hath it a ſtable ſubſiſtence, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not to be a ſubſtance intellectuall or a ſpirit. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth not follow, that becauſe the ſoul is not a perſon,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:114895:46"/>or a compleat entity, after ſeparation, that therefore it can have no action, but muſt either ſleep or dy. The ſoul, be it ſeparated or united, is a ſpirit, a ſpirit is intellective, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective ſubſtance can neither dy, nor wholly ceaſe from action, as before hath been proved, and therefore is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable either of ſleep or ſlumber, or in any danger of being benummed, and, much leſſe, of death.</p>
               <p>To the third I anſwer, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh there, not of Chriſtian ſouls being miſerable, but of Chriſtian mens being ſo; and therefore let the ſouls be never ſo happy after death, yet, if there ſhould be no reſurrection, the men could be never otherwiſe then miſerable, yea farre more miſerable then any other men; becauſe in this life they ſhould be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in a higher degree then others, and in the next they ſhould not be at all. You will ſay, What matter is it if the men be miſerable in this world, and never happy in any world, ſo the ſouls in the next world be made happy? In oppoſition to this, I ſay, Yes, it is a matter, and a very great matter alſo, if we will weigh things rightly; for to be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the whole, and afterward to be happy onely by the halfes, is a great and capitall inconvenience. Let the ſoul be where it will, and as happy as can be, yet if the body do not riſe again, but ly trampled under foot, &amp; be triumphed over by death everlaſtingly, the condition of man, as man, would be very miſerable, &amp; that of a Chriſtian more then of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary man. Beſides, as the ſoul findes pain and contentment by the body in this life, ſo ought it afterwards, or elſe it would want ſomewhat of the former perfection.</p>
               <p>To the fourth part I anſwer, that notwithſtanding the ſoul be happy before the reſurrection, yet great will the advantage be that both the ſoul and alſo the whole man ſhall get at that great day. For then at that time man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers himſelf, &amp; is put into a new poſſeſſion of what he loſt by death: now what, I beſeech you, can be dearer and more welcome unto man then he himſelf is? neither can his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory

                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:114895:48"/>over death be compleated till then; neither again is his crown of glory finiſhed before that recovery be made. Beſides this, the ſoul alſo gains not a little portion of felicity by this recovery, for ſo think many grave Doctours, both ancient and modern; but what is the certainty or the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, that is a myſtery which we know not, yet ſome may gueſſe that, as at the reſurrection there is an acceſſion of one eſſentiall half of man added to the ſoul which is the other half eſſentiall, ſo alſo there is one half, greater or leſſe, of felicity that doth then accrew; and is not one half of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city a notable acceſſion and a great advantage? It may well be, for ought <hi>Volkelius</hi> knowes to the contrary, that the ſoul, during the ſtate of ſeparation, ſhall have allotted to it, by the verdict of the firſt Judgement, which is a judgement of ſouls, ſuch a portion onely or proportion of felicity as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto it under the title of being a <hi>forme aſſistent,</hi> in which capacity it might act divers things by it ſelf, without aſſiſtance or cooperation of the body; but at the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the ſame ſoul ſhall have, by a verdict of the ſecond Judgement, which is a judgement of men, another portion of felicity allotted to it, ſo much, namely, as might correſpond unto the ſoul as it is a <hi>forme informing,</hi> and makes up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the body organicall one compleat agent, which compleat agent is the Authour and Actour of the greater part of all the actions of this life.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Eſtius in a. ſent. diſt.</hi> 45. § 7. <hi>ad.</hi> 4.</note> So that the former portion of felicity hath a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the ſoul alone; the later portion, both to ſoul and body, not as they are ſeverall, but as united and knit up into one. All this, whether it be true or no I know not, but yet thus much I know, that it may be true for ought that <hi>Volkelius</hi> hath ſaid, and therefore is it ſufficient to break the force of his argument, and wholly to evacuate it, till he have proved the contrary.</p>
               <p>My concluſion is, that as in death there is a ſorrowfull departing, and the farewell between ſoul and body is a very
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114895:48"/>ſad one: ſo in like ſort, at the reſurrection, when they meet never after to be divorced, there needs muſt be a joyfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview between them, and thoſe ſecond nuptials be a moſt ſolemne feſtivall, a day of light and exultation, in which the mutual congratulations will be unexpreſſible. And therefore, let <hi>Volkelius</hi> imagine what he pleaſes, the ſoul by the laſt day, and by the reſurrection, will be a mighty gainer, and receive new joyes, new treaſures of felicity.</p>
               <p>To the alledged place of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> I anſwer, that it makes nothing at all for <hi>Volkelius</hi> his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe it is not ſaid there, that <hi>without the reſurrection there is no felicity,</hi> but onely, that our faith was void unleſſe Chriſt had riſen; and if our faith were void, then would all promiſes of comfort and felicity be void alſo, and ſo, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, neither our ſouls nor our bodies ſhould attain to happineſſe. Out of which defect it would alſo follow, that Chriſtians of all other men ſhould be the moſt miſerable, becauſe they in this life ſhould have more afflictions &amp; fewer comforts then other men, &amp; in the next life have none at all, nor any thing wherewith to recompenſe them for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, abſtinences and ſufferings here. But ſay that the ſouls might be compleatly happy, although there ſhould be no reſurrection; yet, nevertheleſſe, even in this caſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Chriſtian would be more ſad and more unhappy then that of other men, ſo farre forth as concerns his body, at the leaſt, which is one half of man, and one eſſentiall part, and alſo is that of which the Apoſtle doth in this place princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally entreat: and ſo the Adverſaries argument can conclude no way.</p>
               <p>You may further object, that in ſundry places of holy Scripture dying men are ſaid to <hi>ſleep,</hi> for example, <hi>with their fathers:</hi> and this manner of ſpeaking is very frequent. But the anſwer is manifeſt, becauſe this word <hi>ſleep</hi> is meant of the body onely, which being dead, lies in the ſepulchre qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly as in a bed, and is at the great day to be called up again,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:114895:49"/>as one that wakened out of a ſleep, a very dead one. Beſides, this word <hi>ſleep,</hi> when meant of the ſoul, is onely a ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall expreſſion.</p>
               <p>My Concluſion is with <hi>S. Hierome ad Pammach. Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralem &amp; aternam animam in modum glirium, immobilem torpentemque ſentire non poſſumus. We cannot be perſwaded that the incorporeall and everlasting ſoul is, like to a Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſe, immoveable and benummed;</hi> or to Swallowes that ſleep all winter. So thought this ancient Doctour: and for our own part, we can be as ſoon perſwaded that the ſoul may dream, as that it ſhould ſleep: and, if we will believe <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus magnus in</hi> 4. <hi>diſt.</hi> 44. <hi>ar.</hi> 41. to hold that ſeparated ſouls ſhould dream, were a thing ridiculous, and therefore no leſſe to think that they can ſleep or ſlumber.</p>
               <p>Again, as <hi>Carolus Bovillus</hi> noteth, it is a thing contrary to nature, reaſon and Philoſophy, to put any ſubſtance deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of connaturall operation: wherefore either grant the operation, or elſe take away the ſubſtance; and ſo let the ſouls of men either be active and awake, or elſe let them not be at all; for to ſay they are, and yet are not opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, is a groſſe <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> and not to be admitted by men of reaſon. Wherefore, if we grant the ſoul to be a ſubſtance intellectuall, then to go conſequently to this, we muſt alſo grant it to be immortall; and again, if both intellectuall and immortall, that then alſo it can never ceaſe from the exerciſe of connaturall operations, and ſo, laſtly, can never be a ſleep. I end this chapter with the magiſtrall doctrine of the learned <q>

               </head>
               <p>THere have not wanted, both in this time, and alſo in former ages, ſome <hi>Icarian</hi> wits, who, I know not why, have laboured to extenuate and to diminiſh the force of the arguments uſually brought in favour of the ſouls inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, not doubting to give it out, that they be not demonſtrative. But this exception of theirs failes more of being demonſtrative, then the reaſons do againſt which they except: for, admit they be not properly demonſtrative, yet nevertheleſſe may they be proofes very ſufficient, and able to perſuade any man that is unpartiall, and governed by reaſon, and alſo much ſtronger than any which hitherto have been brought againſt it, and ſo are to carry the cauſe on their ſide.</p>
               <p>I will not deny but that thoſe ſame reaſons may not be ſo cleare and perſpicuous, as ſome are which we have for ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other verities, the cauſe whereof may ſeem to be the ſouls immuring within corporeall organs, as in a dark houſe or priſon, in which it being ſhut up, although it may behold out at the windows of the body objects abroad illuſtrated with light, yet at home, by reaſon of the domeſtick obſcurity, it cannot do the like. This ſame difficulty, moreover, is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe the ſoul of man is an entity placed in the confines betwixt the two regions of ſubſtances ſpiritual and corporeal, and ſo of nature more ambiguous and hard to be diſcerned, by reaſon that in this poſture, it may ſometimes ſeem to be belonging to one ſide, and ſometimes again unto the others and ſo much alſo the eaſier, becauſe the ſoul, while it is in the body, diſcharges a two-ſold duty, <hi>viz.</hi> one of a <hi>form infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> as Philoſophers uſe to call it, ſuch, namely, as is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the ſouls inferiour, conformably to the doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> the other of a <hi>form aſſiſtent,</hi> agreeable to the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:114895:50"/>School of <hi>Plato,</hi> unto which <hi>Campanella</hi> doth ſubſcribe. Such a form as this is God unto the world, and is therefore ſtiled <hi>Anima mundi</hi> by very many, the Soul of the Univerſe; of which ſort <hi>Intelligences</hi> be, according to the Peripateticks, in reſpect of their ſeverall Orbes, and a Pilote in a ſhip, as alſo other movers and directers of that nature. And this double office the ſoul performeth, becauſe even as it is ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall it doth not onely animate the body, and is it ſelf alſo a formall ingredient, and conſtitutes man in his ſpecificall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of being, and thereby diſtinguiſhes him eſſentially from all other creatures, which functions belong unto the ſoul as it is a form informing: but beſides all this, acts the part of a form aſſiſtent, reſiding in the body as a high Dictatour, controlling it, commanding and countermanding, preſcribing laws, inflicting puniſhments, exerciſing acts of juriſdiction and abſolute ſoveraignty, thereby reſembling a Judge upon the bench, or Prince upon his throne, more then a form meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informing: whereas, contrariwiſe, the ſoul of a Beaſt lives in ſubjection to the body, being therein compelled to follow the preſcription of every ſenſuall appetite after a ſervile or ſlaviſh manner, without any power to make reſiſtance. Wherefore not without good cauſe did <hi>Fl. Joſephus</hi> ſtile the power of reaſon a Soveraignty, or Empire. In conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo of this two-old office of the ſoul, ſeemed it to have two names given it, one relating to it as it is a form inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, namely, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Thoſe who will be ever quarrelling with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his School about thoſe doctrines which have paſſed the Teſt, after ſo many examinations by the moſt able Wits for no ſmall number of ages, may, peradventure, be overmat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and return out of the fray with broken heads. To im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne this or that ſingle doctrine, this or that one argument, may paſſe for currant, and peradventure alſo prove ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: but he that will undertake to raiſe a whole new frame of Philoſophy, and encounter with <hi>Aristotle</hi> at every turn, ſtands in need to have the wit of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, few of theſe new undertakers have had, yea, ſuch bold attempts do ſhew the adventurers capacities not to have been very great.</p>
               <p>Let the quarrellers go on and try their fortune, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience they may finde that the arguments for immortality had deeper roots then they imagined. Surely, that doctrine to which the moſt intelligent perſons of the very Heathens gave their aſſent, either wanted not good arguments to prove it, or elſe bad arguments had very ſtrange and incredible ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. It could not be but thoſe proofes were very forcible, which were able to enforce an opinion of life, even after the ruines made upon man by death, at which time no power in nature was able to make a reſtauration; and then alſo when few or no meſſengers came to them from the dead; but, contrariwiſe, man after his departure was heard of no more, nor any news was ſent them from the other life. It is true that <hi>Epicurus</hi> ſtood aſtoniſht at the ſight of death, and of the many diſorders and diſturbances in this world, and therefore wickedly denyed both providence divine, and alſo immortality, which was a conſequent thereof. But other Philoſophers were wiſer and more conſiderate then ſo, and would not forſake the Truths of providence and of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, becauſe of an encountring difficulty which they could not overcome: and therefore, touching the other world, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> held it the wiſeſt way to be ſilent, <hi>Plato</hi> had recourſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114895:51"/>to fictions of his own, touching circulations and <hi>Palingeneſiae</hi> after every of his great yeares to be accompliſhed, <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> fled for ſuccour to his tranſmigrations or <hi>Metempſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choſes,</hi> the <hi>Stoicks</hi> to open falſhoods and improbabilities, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, contrary to the expreſſe determinations of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> that men might be happy by vertue alone, and that no corporeall miſeries were evills. In fine, here <hi>Ethnick</hi> Philoſophy was deficient, not being able to ſatisfie, or come home unto us, nor to reſolve us in our greateſt doubts: but theſe great vacancies of Philoſophy were to be ſupplyed by <hi>Christian religion</hi> alone, juſt as the doubts about the <hi>Antipodes</hi> were to be cleared by the diſcoveries of adventurous navigatours; for it is Chriſtian religion alone which doth ſolve this <hi>Gordian</hi> knot, <hi>Et caeteri tanquam umbrae vagantur,</hi> and all the reſt, like ſhadows, do wander up and down. It was Chriſt, the Lamb of God, who open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the books of providence, which formerly had been ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up, and the contents hidden from the eyes of any mortall man. Againſt the <hi>Antipodes:</hi> and the habitation of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Zone</hi> great difficulties were urged, yet, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, the reaſons on the contrary ſide were ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as they carried many of the wiſeſt with them, as, by name, <hi>Polybius</hi> the hiſtorian, <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> as we may ſee in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, &amp; Virgilius B. of Saltz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg;</hi> which <hi>Virgil.</hi> being miſs-underſtood by his unskilfull auditours that made a falſe report of what he taught, he had like to have incurred a heavy cenſure for it: <hi>Aventin. l.</hi> 3. <hi>hiſt.</hi> The two caſes, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>torrid zone</hi> and of <hi>immortality,</hi> be not much unlike; for, as the <hi>Antipodes</hi> were denied by many, becauſe they were beyond the torrid zone, which for the extremity of heat, was eſteem'd unpaſſable; ſo the beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of man, unto which immortality is addreſſed, was held in doubt by many, by reaſon of the frozen zone of death, which lyes between our preſent life and that; which icye cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, by reaſon of the extremity of cold, could not, as it was
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114895:52"/>thought, be paſſed over by any mortall man. All which difficulty was encreaſed by the ſeeming deficiency of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over the affaires of man; the conſideration of which did move even the ableſt and the beſt men, as namely, <hi>Job, David, Salomon, Jeremy,</hi> and amongſt later men, <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Boetius;</hi> although it prevailed not with them, as it had done with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who, if he had pleaſed, might have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived eaſily that the want of ſome order and equalities in this life did plainly argue another to come after it; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the admirable contrivement of the world for the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall part, does evict as carefull a proviſion alſo for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. What, ſhall we think that the great Authour of things was a better naturall Philoſopher then a morall, or that he was more powerfull then he was good? no greater an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity then this could be ſwallowed down by any: and ſo <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi> while he ſought to fly a ſeeming inconvenience, ſell into a reall; and for the avoyding of a leſſer diſſiculty, fell into a greater. This world is the <hi>Stage,</hi> men the <hi>Actours,</hi> our life the <hi>Play.</hi> An action muſt not be judged by one <hi>Scene,</hi> but by all together, and chiefly by the laſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that be ſhewed no condemnation can paſſe, nor <hi>Plaudue</hi> be given. God then being ſo great an Artiſt in compoſing, and alſo in continuall ordering of this Theatre and of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious lights that hang about it, may be preſumed not to have been leſſe provident in the Action which is to be repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on it, then he was about the Theatre it ſelf; unleſſe we would admit that the <hi>Stage</hi> ſhould be more artificiall then the <hi>Play,</hi> and that the <hi>Architect</hi> was better and more skilfull then the <hi>Poet.</hi> By the actions, then, of God in his works of <hi>Nature,</hi> he hath given us a moſt ſufficient ſecurity for his works of <hi>Moralitie,</hi> and neither <hi>Epicurus</hi> nor any other had cauſe ſufficient to call it into queſtion. Wherefore the other liſe muſt be the laſt <hi>ſcene,</hi> and that one muſt bring all to order, and make amends for all the defects and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances in the former; and ſo, conſequently, for the finiſhing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:114895:52"/>of all, a ſucceeding life and a continuated immortality muſt be allowed us. This inference ſeems ſo cleare and evident, that, if no ſhip of nature could paſſe the line of death, but after a tempeſtuous voyage and a perilous poor labourſome mortality it muſt be thrown over board into the deeps, and there periſh everlaſtingly, then, if humane underſtanding might preſume to give a judgement, the ſpectatours of this tragedy would not doubt to ſay, this play was neither worth the acting, nor the making, yea and beſides, that ſo curious and well-built a ſtage was ill-beſtowed upon ſo mean a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie. If all that is of man muſt end in death and come unto a totall diſſolution, we can ſcarce withhold from ſetting upon it this cenſure, namely, That in the Architecture there wanted much ſymmetry or proportion, becauſe the gate was made bigger then the city, and beſides, that mighty were the preparations, but the feaſt was hungry and penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
               <p>It was not, then, the falſe and flattering deſire in man of living ever, and of ſurviving his ſhort and tranſitory plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this world, which did perſuade him immortality, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as <hi>Pliny</hi> vainly did ſurmiſe; but Nature her ſelf it was which did riſe up in us for vindicating of her own right, of which the unadviſed ſchool of <hi>Epicurus</hi> did labour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſe her. And doubtleſſe thoſe arguments in favour of immortality could not be otherwiſe then very powerfull and weighty, that, in the midſt of <hi>Ethniciſme,</hi> were of ability to prevail, and by their force to ſtemme the violent tides of ſo many advancing difficulties as daily did ariſe, and alſo to charme the Furies, which, out of the dark retreats of humane ignorance and imbecillity, did inceſſantly moleſt them. For, in very deed, it was the unknown and then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered hemiſphere of the other life which cauſed many, but the <hi>Epicurcans</hi> eſpecially, utterly to deſpaire, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude our little light and joyes within the circles of humane mortality; juſt as the ignorant vulgar did conceive that the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:114895:53"/>Sun, when it goes down to us, did lye concealed and bathed it ſelf in <hi>Tethis</hi> ſalt waves, untill the following morn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to call upon it. Can, I ſay, theſe reaſons of perſuaſion be counted weak, that were able, from age to age, to carry on the doctrine of immortality againſt the violent ſtreams of death and diſſolution? which ſeemed to be diſeaſes irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable, and by them a man brought into a ſtate that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate and never to be altered; and therefore it was an uſual ſaying, <hi>Mors ultima linea rerum,</hi> Death is the utmoſt line of things, beyond which there is no going, and as it were the pillars of <hi>Hercules</hi> with the <hi>Nil ultra</hi> graven on them. Neither were thoſe ſame reaſons able, after corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and aſhes, to reare up a ſingle frame of life for perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity onely in the ſoul of man, but alſo to attempt it for the body, yea and to come very neare the abſolute proving of it, and the evicting of a Reſurrection, as a thing due unto the principles of nature, and as a ſequele alſo of the attribute of <hi>Juſtice divine:</hi> in conſideration of which two reaſons, it appeares, that albeit the Reſurrection cannot be naturall, yet it is a very neare borderer upon nature, and, that we may ſo ſpeak, not diſtant from it three fingers breadths, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall or diſtance between them being no more then the want of a naturall agent that might be able to reunite the ſoul and body after ſeparation. Whereupon I conclude, that the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the body is none of the hardeſt articles of our faith, but contrariwiſe ſuch a one as may be perſuaded eaſily.</p>
               <p>In confirmation of this truth, I cannot paſſe over in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence a memorable conference between <hi>Almaricus</hi> king of Jeruſalem and <hi>William B.</hi> of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> recorded by <hi>Tyrius</hi> himſelf <hi>libro</hi> 19. <hi>capite</hi> 3. <hi>de bello ſacre.</hi> The queſtion propounded to by the king was this, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>Whether, ſetting aſide the doctrine of our Saviour and of the Saints that followed him, the Reſurrection could be proved by any evident and convincing arguments? To which, being moved with the newneſſe of the word, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114895:53"/>That the doctrine of our Saviour and Redeemer was ſufficient, who, in many places of the Goſpel, doth teach us moſt manifeſtly that the Reſurrection is to be, and that he is to come as Judge, to judge both the living and the dead, &amp; the world by fire; as alſo, that he will give unto the elect a kingdome prepared for them from the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, &amp; to the wicked fire everlaſting, prepared for the Devil and his angels: Beſides, the pious aſſertion of the Apoſtles and Fathers of the old Teſtament may be ſufficient. To which he made anſwer, All this I firmly hold, but yet do deſire a reaſon wherewith I might prove it to one who ſhould deny this, and did not receive the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, namely, that the Reſurrection is to come, and after death another life. To whom my anſwer was, Take upon you then, ſaid I, the perſon of one ſo affected, and let us try whether or no we can finde out any thing. Content, ſaid he. Then I, You do confeſſe that God is juſt? Then he, I hold nothing to be more true. Then I replied, Is it juſtice to return to the juſt good things for their good deeds, and to the wicked evil things for their wickedneſſe? Then he, It is very right. Then I, But in our preſent life this is not done: becauſe in this world, good men finde nothing but afflictions and adverſities, but the wicked enjoy a continued proſperity, as dayly examples do teach us. Then he, It is a certainty. Then I proceeded; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is to be done in another life, becauſe God cannot be otherwiſe then a juſt rewarder: therefore there is to be another life, and a reſurrection of this body of ours in which we deſerved good or evil, and therefore ought to receive a reward accordingly. Then he, This pleaſes me exceedingly, and by it all my doubting is taken off.</q> Thus farre are the words of the grave and faithfull hiſtorian <hi>Guil. Tyrius.</hi>

               <p>THat mans ſoul muſt have the being by generation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the man himſelf hath his being by it, is no good conſequence; and the reaſon why ſome have been deceived in judging it a good one, or that of due his ſoul ought to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated as well as the ſouls of Beaſts, hath been partly a falſe apprehenſion what the true nature and eſſence of generation was, &amp; partly alſo what was the perfection &amp; eſſence of man.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt miſpriſion, it was, that generation was not only to make the <hi>compoſitu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> or whole to be, but alſo the parts, by the conferring unto them not onely the being parts, but alſo the ſimple Being, or the being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ties, that is to ſay, not onely the formality of them, but even the naturality; which conceit of theirs is a falſe conception, and againſt all reaſon and principles of Philoſophy: for by them we are clearly taught that it is Man which is procreated, or made by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and not his ſoul, his body is made or framed by it, and not the matter of which it is compoſed. For it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived maxime and moſt true, touching the power of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſes at leaſt, though no farther, <hi>Quòd ex nihilo nihil fit;</hi> Of nothing there is nothing to be made: out of which it follows, that before generation, both matter and formes of all corporeall things muſt have before-hand a being in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> at leaſt an incompleat one, and cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114895:54"/>have it from generation. Wherefore by the work of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration they are not made, or receive any new abſolute en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, but onely are collected, ordered, and at laſt ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially linked and united one with another; which union is not by a ſole approximation, contiguity, or <hi>juxta</hi>-poſition, that I may ſo ſpeak, of one of them with another, as it falls out in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall compounds, where colours, for example, though they be not pictures, yet being thus or thus choſen, formed and united, make up ſuch or ſuch a picture; but it is by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, or an inward and ſubſtantiall knot, which is in our power better to conceive then explicate, and yet not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive fully neither, for theſe principles of generation are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>arcana,</hi> her darkeſt and moſt ſecret myſteries, which, like the ſprings of <hi>Nilus,</hi> ſhe hath hidden from our eyes, as if our ſeeing of them were a profanation, thereby to let us know that ſhe is our mother, and we but ignorant children, and ſuch who muſt not be made much acquainted with our originall.</p>
               <p>Again, if the parts alſo muſt be generated, I ask, whether theſe parts be ſimple or compound entities. If ſimple, they cannot be generated, but muſt have their being by creation; if compound, then if they muſt be generated, the parts alſo of which thoſe parts are made muſt in like ſort be generated; and ſo either <hi>in infinitum,</hi> or elſe at leaſt, till we come to ſome parts which a ſimple and ingenerable: by which diſcourſe it follows that no parts at all, neither corporeall nor ſpirituall, neither in man nor beaſts, do receive their being by generation.</p>
               <p>As for Accidents, they cannot be properly ſaid either to be generated or corrupted, but do follow the fortunes of the ſubſtances in which they are to inhere; and beſides, are the formall effects of <hi>Alteration,</hi> and not of <hi>Generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the ſecond miſpriſion, or originall of errour and miſtaking, note, that although it belong to the perfection of an Animal to generate another like it ſelf, yet is it a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely to Animals and Vegetables; and to them alſo not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114895:55"/>ſimply, but onely <hi>quatenus corruptibilia,</hi> ſo farre forth as they are corruptible, generation being inſtituted onely for repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of decayes, and to re-edify the ruines of corruption; ſo that whereſoever there be more ruines, in that place more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edification is needfull. In creatures therefore irrationall, where there is a corruption more large then in the rationall, a fuller manner of generation is neceſſary, becauſe there is a greater decay in the forme in the one then in the other; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the formes of irrationall creatures be by corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on disformalized and diſſipated into their atomes, which diſſipation, if the formes were ſpirituall, needed not; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if indiviſible, were a thing impoſſible. Therefore ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is to perform more in one then the other, and yet ſufficiently in both, according to their ſeverall exigences. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then generation is nothing but <hi>Productio viventis à vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vente in ſimilitudinem naturae,</hi> A production of one living thing by another in a ſimilitude of nature; according to the definition thereof, whatſoever agent ſhall do this, that ſame is truly and univocally ſaid to generate, how much more or leſſe ſoever it do beſides this. A man therefore producing another man by the onely compoſing and uniting his two eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall parts, body and ſoul, maketh that to be a man which before was none, and doth truly generate a man, although he no more produce his ſoul, then he does the matter of which his body is formed and made; for there can be no more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for the production of the one then of the other. And this one inſtance of matter will evidently deſtroy our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries argument taken from procreation.</p>
               <p>Neither is it, as <hi>Argenterius</hi> well declareth, any imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in man not to generate ſo fully as other Animals do, but rather a great perfection in him: for as it is a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in beaſts to generate totally as much as generation can do, becauſe they are totally corruptible as much as in nature it is poſſible; and as in Angels it were an imperfection to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, becauſe they by their nature are totally incorruptible;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114895:55"/>ſo in man it is a perfection to generate as Angels doe not doe, and alſo not to generate ſo totally and fully as brute beaſts do generate, becauſe he is, as the Philoſophers rightly and aptly term him, <hi>Horizon mundi, &amp; nexus naturae utri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſque;</hi> as it were, the Horizon of the world, and that which knits corporeall and ſpirituall natures together, by his partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating with them both, and not fully agreeing with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; not being ſo corruptible as beaſts, nor ſo incorruptible as Angels or pure Intelligences. By which it follows, that his manner of generation is in ſomething to agree with the non-generation of Angels; and again, in ſomething with the totall generation of creatures irrationall: that ſame genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his being truely and univocally a generation, becauſe he is univocally and truly an Animal, and yet not totally ſo, becauſe in his immortall ſoul he reſembles the incorruptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Angels or Intelligences. For <hi>Modus generandi ſequitur modum eſſendi: &amp; ideo quod partim eſt immortale &amp; partim non, partim etiam generare debet &amp; partim non.</hi> That which is not wholly mortall doth not wholly generate: and therefore neither man nor beaſt doth generate wholly, yet a beaſt more wholly then a man; and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a beaſt is a creature which is more imperfect. Where note by the way, that the more imperfect any entity is, the more imperfect is the manner of production; and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that which is moſt perfect hath no production or origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall at all. Therefore God, who is the moſt perfect entity, is not cauſed any way, nor producible, either by generation or creation. Angels or Intelligences, who are next in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of being to him, come to be by the work of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and not of a Parent or Generatour, as being entities, according to the principles of their nature, immateriall, ſimple and ingenerable. Man, who is next in degree to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and of a twofold nature, was therefore partly to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by creation, ſo farre as he communicates with Angels, or abſtracted formes; and partly again by generation, ſo
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114895:56"/>farre forth as he communicates with inferiour entities, which are concretee ſubſtances and wholly immerſt in matter: wherefore to be generated totally, as Beaſts are for asmuch as concerns their formes, is no perfection, but an imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor agreeable to man's nature and perfection, but adverſe and derogating from it. And conſequently hereunto, who ſo thinks that Man, a rationall creature, ſhould either generate totally another like himſelf, or elſe totally be generated, thinks groſſely and unworthily of him, and not as his principles of nature do require. Wherefore <hi>Toſtatus, c.</hi> 1. <hi>Gen. q.</hi> 27. ſaid very rightly and Philoſophically; <hi>An Aſſe doth generate an Aſſe more properly, then a Man doth generate a Man.</hi> For whatſoever is wholly generated, is alſo wholly corruptible; and ſo alſo on the contrary ſide; for as <hi>Boethius</hi> tells us,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Conſtat aterna poſitumque lege eſt,</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore if ſome of him after corruption doe remain there can be no neceſſity that all of man ſhould be made by generation; nay, ſeeing ſomething more of him, namely the forme after corruption doth remain incorrupted, more, I ſay then there doth of beaſts, for of beaſts the matter onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, therefore ſomething leſſe of him is to be produced by generation then there is of them, though all of neither. Who ſoever therefore ſhall affirme that a creature intelligent like man ſhould generate another of his own kinde as totally and adequately as one beaſt does generate another, doth not ſpeak like a Philoſopher, and beſides doth unjuſtly diſparage and diſgrace his own lineage, and violates the rights of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>A ſolution of the Adverſaries objections, together with ſome others of Doctour</hi> Daniel Sennertus.</head>
               <p>THeſe former <hi>notandums</hi> having been premiſed, we need not dwell long upon anſwering of objections, for by them the way is opened already, and that which before hath been delivered will not need any more then application.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Whole man is generated by man, therefore all his parts, both ſoul and body: and if both be generated, then both are mortall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whole man is generated by man, I grant it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both ſoul and body are generated: I diſtinguiſh; That both ſoul and body are made parts of man by generation, and a creature produced like in nature to him that generates; I alſo grant and do affirm, that by doing of this onely the compleat act of generation or procreation is performed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the received definition of generation before exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the Chapter precedent. But that both ſoul and body muſt be therefore made, and have their entities or beings given them by procreation; that conſequence I deny as falſe and abſurd, yea ſo abſurd as it ſuffers a thouſand inſtances to the contrary. For example, a whole horſe is generated both matter and form, and yet his matter did not receive any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by generation; and ſo it falls out in other creatures. If then it be not neceſſary that the matter receive the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by procreation, though the whole Animal conſiſting of matter and forme be truely generated, what reaſon can there be why to the generation of the whole Animal, a new being of the forme, by vertue of procreation ſhould be neceſſary? or why can one be neceſſary to generation, when as we ſee evidently the other is not? or why again ſhould we exact the new production of either of them by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Argenter. com. in Aphor.</hi> 1. <hi>Hippocr. &amp; Zacutus Luſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus tom.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>Hiſt. ad praxin, c.</hi> 7. § <hi>ſed alia.</hi>
                  </note> when without any ſuch act the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of generation is fulfilled, and agrees both unto the generation of beaſts, whoſe matter is
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:114895:57"/>not generated, and to the generation of man, whoſe forme is not generated any more then his matter is? By force of this ſolution all his imaginary abſurdities, which he labours to faſten upon the non-procreation of the ſoul, doe of themſelves diſſolve.</p>
               <p>If the ſoul, ſaith he, be infuſed, then Chriſt did not take whole Humanity from the ſeed of the woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He received from the ſeed of the woman as much of the Humanity as was to be received thence, &amp; that which he took did not come unto him by procreation, nor was it ſo to do. As for the fourteenth to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> which he cites for his purpoſe, our anſwer to it is, That it is not found in our books, neither Greek nor Latin, neither do the Editions of <hi>Raphelengius</hi> or <hi>Elzevir</hi> contain any more Chapters than thirteen.</p>
               <p>If, ſaith he, we conſiſt of ſoul and body, and are not men without both, and receive not our ſoules from him, (he means the Generatour, as I ſuppoſe) then <hi>Adam</hi> is the father of no man, nor Chriſt the ſon of man, becauſe his manhood's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive part, even that which ſhould make him a man, could not be by the ſeed of the woman, and a man is as much a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of fleas and lice, which receive their matter from him, as of his children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Surely fleas and lice, whence ſoever they receive their matter, do not proceed from him in likeneſs of nature; as by the definition, they, if they were generated by man, ought to do. Moreover, they are not generated by man, but of him, neither is he the agent, but the patient, and ſo is of theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min no generatour at all, proper or improper. Secondly, men do receive their ſoules by force of generation, although they be not generated; and ſo, notwithſtanding this non-generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoul, <hi>Adam</hi> might truly and univocally be the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all men; and alſo the ſoul of Chriſt might come by the ſeed of the woman, although it were not made or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created by it.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:114895:57"/>
               <p>If the ſoul (addes he) be infuſed after the conception, then there is growth before there is life, which is impoſſible, for the ſoul is made the vegetative as well as the motive, ſenſitive, or rationall part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant that before the infuſion of the ſoul there may be vegetation, and this by the ſole virtue of the ſperme; but I deny that therefore there be in man more ſouls than one, that is, than the rationall: for this ſame force of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation which is in the ſeed, holdeth it ſelf upon the part of the matter onely, and doth not performe the office of a ſoul or forme, the ſubſtance and operation thereof being no more then to faſhion an organicall body, and to make it fit for the reception of the ſoul and the union with it, after whoſe infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, both the vitall and animall ſpirits do but ſerve as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to it, and to accompliſh the body in making it to be ſo perfectly organicall as the eminency of a rationall ſpirit above other formes doth require to have it.</p>
               <p>If the ſoul be not generated, but infuſed into a dead body, then, ſaith he, it is lawfull to be Nigromancer; for Nigro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy is nothing but putting a ſpirit into a dead body, and ſo it is imitation of God, and God the onely Nigro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancer, and all the men in the world but Nigromantick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions, whoſe ſpirits, when they have done the work for which they were put into the bodies, deſert them as other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Ghoſts do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> See the ſhallowneſſe of this man, who can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeak right, nor reaſon with common ſenſe and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. He calls Necromancy conſtantly Nigromancy, and he ſuppoſes that a ſoul in a dead body makes a living man, and can exerciſe vitall actions in it, or actions of life, and ſo, according to his groſſe capacity, if the ſoul be infuſed God muſt be a Necromancer, and men but Necromantick appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for this <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> it ſeems, knowes no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſoul and body that are united, and thoſe that are not united, but together onely, nor between a body living by the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:114895:58"/>virtue of the ſpirit, and by virtue thereof doing vitall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and another which is onely moved and inhabited by a ſpirit, without any union with it or participation of life. But ſuppoſing all were one, yet were it not lawfull to be a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancer, becauſe nothing at all, be it never ſo good, is to be done by ſuperſtitious actions, or by making any recourſe unto the Devil, and acknowledgement of his power by any dependency on him whatſoever, more or leſſe.</p>
               <p>It is granted, ſaith he, that the body conſidered merely ſenſitive cannot ſin, and is but an inſtrument, or as the pen in the hand of the writer. Therefore if the ſoul be infuſed, then of neceſſity the immortall thing, and not our mortall fleſh is the authour of all ſin, and ſo God's immediate hand the cauſe of all ſin.</p>
               <p>That the body is onely an inſtrument of the ſoul is falſe,
<note place="margin">See <hi>Soto</hi> of this in 4. <hi>d.</hi> 43. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>a.</hi> 2. <hi>Rat.</hi> 3.</note> for it is a living co-agent with it, and a partaker both in the good and evil actions, and is both rewardable and puniſhable with it; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the mean time it be created or generated, for this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation makes no difference in this matter of merit or deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Neither doth the creation of the ſoul make God the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of ſin more than the generation of it, that is to ſay, not at all, for ſtill the ſoul and body are authours of their own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and the deformity ariſeth from their miſdemeanour, and not from God's creation or concurrence.</p>
               <p>Doctour <hi>Sennertus,</hi> although he admit not of any morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the ſoul, yet he holds it probable that it comes by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, and that from the firſt inſtance of conception, the ſeed is ammated with the rationall ſoul: which Doctrine of his, by his leave, inferrs mortality: for whatſoever is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, is corruptible, and is to go out, according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary lawes of Nature, at the ſame gate of corruption at which it entred in. Neither is it true, or likely, or laſtly, any way Philoſophicall, to ſay as he doth <hi>Hypom.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 10. as alſo in his <hi>Paralipomena c.</hi> 7. <hi>n.</hi> 3. <hi>ad Hypomn.</hi> 5. that nothing cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:114895:58"/>is immortall by the principle of Nature, but onely by the free will or gift of God; becauſe as it is amongſt bodies, ſome are very durable, as Marble and Cedar, ſome by and by corrupted, as Flowers &amp; Fruits, even out of the ſeveral na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of their compoſition which God hath appointed for them, and not our of the free will of God immediately, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther relation; ſo in like ſort, ſome ſubſtances are perpetuall out of the nature of their being, as ſpirituall ſubſtances, and bodies that are ſimple and unmixt, other ſome out of their own natures corruptible, as thoſe that are mixt and made up of Elements, which as by ſome naturall agents they were knit up together, ſo by the operation of other ſome they are diſſolvable. Souls then if generated are compounds, and if ſo, may be uncompounded by the agency and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cauſes naturall: wherefore to ſeek an immortality onely from a decree extrinſecall, without any foundation in their naturall beings, ſeems neither to be Philoſophicall, nor true: wherefore the immortality of Souls and Angels is not to be reared upon this weak foundation, according to which a Fly may be as much immortall as an Angel, one by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, according to <hi>Sennertus,</hi> having no preeminence over the other, the free determination of God for their perpetuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation being equally applicable to either of them.</p>
               <p>Conformably to this poſition of his,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sennertus Hypomn.</hi> 4. <hi>ca.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp; lib. de conſenſ. Chymic. cum Ariſt. &amp; Galeno c.</hi> 9.</note> he will needs have the ſperme alwayes ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with a reaſonable ſoul; but then conſider how many more ſouls are caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without any bodies organicall and humane, then are actuated and preſerved by bodies. I ask what muſt become of theſe innumerable ſouls? muſt they periſh, or have bodies made them at the Reſurrection? neither of theſe two can be admitted without great temerity and abſurdities.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, we know God did not inſpire <hi>Adam</hi> with a living ſpirit while he was a lumpe of clay, but when he had a face and a body that was organicall, and not before. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114895:59"/>why does the ſoul depart from the body, but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it leaves to be organicall? why then, or with what probability can we imagine the ſoul is in the inorganicall ſperme? certainly, with none at all.</p>
               <p>The winde that did drive <hi>Sennertus</hi> upon this inhoſpitall ſhore, was the neceſſity of aſſigning a <hi>vis formatrix,</hi> or a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is to ſay, an able architect or former of humane body, which though moſt acknowledge to be the ſeed, yet <hi>Sennertus</hi> ſees not how this can be, unleſſe it ſhould be animated with the ſoul; his reaſon is, becauſe the ſoul only is to build an houſe fit for it ſelf to inhabit. But this reaſon of his is not urgent; nay more, it is not likely; for egges and young birds do not build their own neſts, but the old ones for them; ſo that it muſt, by this account, be the parents office to erect this new building, and not the childes. But how, ſayes he, can the father do this? Eaſily and well, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſperme as his deputy and officer to performe that duty,

                     <hi>Argent. com. in</hi> 1. <hi>Aphoriſ. Hippocr.</hi>
                  </note> as <hi>Argenterius</hi> alſo teacheth; which entity hath derived to it from the generatour ſo much natural ſtrength and cunning, as to make a ſufficient architect for the effecting of this work, and all this may be done with the onely form of ſeed, without any animation of it with a ſoul. Thus it is likely that the Acorn for example, without any more form than of an Acorn, collects ſit particles out of the elements and materials about it, and by a virtue derived from the tree on which it grew, forms out and faſhions the body of an Oake: and for the effecting of this work the ſeed partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates much of the nature of the tree or plant, and hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily much of the ſame virtue. Wherefore in this abſtruſe queſtion or quaere that we may ſay ſomething which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and hath for the truth thereof probable examples and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in nature, we do conceive that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or forming virtue, is the ſeed's own form excited and aſſiſted by the breeding, cheriſhing, and connaturall warmth of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114895:59"/>body, which doth environ it; as in the procreation of birds it ſeems to be, where the <hi>ſemen</hi> of the Cock being cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and ſtirred up by the ambient and incumbent warmth of the Hen, is that which changes the egge, and forms it into the ſhape of the bird from whence it came: neither is it probable, that in ſo ſmall a <hi>coagulum</hi> or ſeed which came from the Cock the ſoul or eſſence of a Cock is reſident.</p>
               <p>Now whereas he tels us, that by the bleſſing granted to all Creatures by the Creatour of them in theſe words, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and multiply,</hi> force was given to every ſoul to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply another: we confeſſe it to be true; yet this not to be done by creating of the younger by the elder ſouls, or by the giving of them new entities; but rather by doing ſome other act out of which theſe forms ſhould connaturally follow, as materiall forms they do by a reſultancy, and immateriall by creation from a higher cauſe, which creation is to follow, and is due by a regular ordination and exigence of Nature; and ſo they may truly be ſaid to be given and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, though not made, by the force of generation. And this is the true <hi>vis prolifica,</hi> and not that other which <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus</hi> feignes unto himſelf, by which he will have one hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſoul to beget another, and on the inſtant to become with childe of it, no bodie knows how; neither by what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular operation, nor from what Mine it ſhould be digged. For this manner of ſpeaking makes ſhew rather of ſome empty Magick, than of ſound Philoſophy, and ſeems alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as hard and impoſſible as the eduction of them out of the potentiality of the <hi>materia prima,</hi> when underſtood in that ſenſe in which he himſelf impugns it.</p>
               <p>If the Parents (objecteth <hi>Sennertus</hi>) do not give the ſoul, which is the form of man, they do not generate the man: but for certain they do generate the man: therefore they give the ſoul alſo: unleſſe they communicate the ſoul, like ſhould not generate his like. So he <hi>Hypomn.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. In brief, I anſwer, that the Parents do give and communicate both
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:114895:60"/>form and matter, but that work they may well do without the making or the producing either of them. It is certain they give the matter, and it is as certain they do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it; wherefore the ſame may be ſaid of the form, without prejudice to the eſſence of generation, or which is all one, of one like or <hi>ſimile</hi> producing of another. And that there is true generation without producing either part, appeareth plainly; for Death, which is the oppoſite to generation, and deſtroyes what the other made, will ſhew us what genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is: but Death is onely a diſſolution of parts united, and not a deſtruction of them; it is deſtructive, not of the matter or form, but of the man: for do but divide a mans ſoul and body, and he is deſtroyed, and remaines not a man any longer, but loſeth what he had got by generation, that is to ſay, by generation he got to be a man, and by dying he loſes it. In fine, as <hi>Argenterius</hi> rightly anſwereth, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is not of the parts, but of the <hi>compoſitum:</hi> and ſo alſo anſwereth <hi>Zacutus</hi> in the place before cited.</p>
               <p>He addes,

                  </note> If the ſperme from the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant be not animated, and the generatour dye in the <hi>interim</hi> before the animation, it might be ſaid that a dead man did generate. I deny the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, becauſe that Parent while he was living did that act, by virtue of which all the reſt (as their turns came) did follow, and that one and firſt act was generation, and not the ſubſequent. As for example, he is ſaid to make a fire who firſt puts the fire to theſe well and kindles it, though all do not burn till a great while after, becauſe all the reſt did follow in virtue of the firſt act.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee that the arguments of <hi>Sennertus</hi> were not ſo urgent and weighty, as to be able to hinder ſuch a wiſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Philoſopher as he was, from relinquiſhing this tenet of his, and from piouſly ſubſcribing his <hi>Pareamus:</hi> by which act he left behinde him an example worthy of great praiſe, and of all true ſtudents to be imitated, I have added to the

               <p>But, ſay you, if that the ſoul be not produced by virtue of the ſperme, how then can Originall Sin be tranſmitted from the loynes of <hi>Adam</hi> down to his poſterity? I anſwer, that it may very well, becauſe that ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> is not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into his deſcendents by any phyſicall influence or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, but contrariwiſe by a legall devolution, or by a way juridicall, which way of conveiancy is founded upon an ordination or covenant, annexed to the act of generation; as alſo the rights of inheritances uſe to be that are ſo devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from father to ſon and ſo downward throughout all the line or pedegree: and to me there ſeeme no more difficulty in one deſcent then in the other, both of them being morall, and both alſo ſuppoſing ſome naturall action for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of them.

               <p>IT is uſually ſaid, that one folly brings on another, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily one worſe than it ſelf: and ſo it falls out with this wretched man againſt whom we deal at this preſent, who after his groſſe errour of mans totall mortality, falls into one which is much groſſer, yea, ſo abſurd, as it is to be numbred amongſt the moſt ridiculous that ever were maintain'd even by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the father of abſurdities, and who was better at that work than any man that went before him. But at the length what may this errour be? I will give it in his own words, and it is this:</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:114895:61"/>
               <p>All other Creatures (ſaith he) ſhall be raiſed and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from Death at the Reſurrection, my reaſons &amp; ground for it, be theſe. Firſt, that otherwiſe the curſe in <hi>Adam</hi> would-extend further than the bleſſing in Chriſt, contrary to the Scriptures, <hi>For as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. Thus he, abuſing Scripture, as we ſee, for the upholding of this his prodigious folly. Surely the man when he reſolved upon theſe things was given over into reprobate ſenſe, and permitted (for his greater confuſion) in ſight both of God and the world, to fall into ſuch an <hi>Abyſſus</hi> of abſurdity, as that no man might take harm or be ſeduced by him, but ſuch onely who had a mind to be deceived.</p>
               <p>It ſeems then by this beſtiall Doctrine, that at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection all the Gnats and Fleas that ever were ſhall be revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, all the Toads and Frogs and poyſonous Serpents and other vermin. Certainly thoſe who are to live amongſt all theſe are likely to have gallant time of it. His places of Scripture which he profanes in alleadging to prove this, need no expoſitour nor anſwer to them, for I think no Reader is ſo ſimple as cannot do it by himſelf. Doubtleſſe both accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common principles of Chriſtianity, and alſo thoſe particulars of this Authour, Chriſt is the cauſe of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; and none are to riſe but thoſe onely for whom he died, and therefore ſince he died not for beaſts, they are not to have any Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>As for the Aſſertion, it is groſſer and more inexcuſable in this Authour, than it was in <hi>Mahomet,</hi> becauſe this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> made a Paradiſe and felicity agreeing moſt of all to beaſts and men of beſhall diſpoſitions; for as it is well known out of the <hi>Alfurcan</hi> or <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> an ancient and faithfull Hiſtorian relateth, <q>His Paradiſe was place of corporall eating and drinking,

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:114895:61"/>with wine and hony and milke, together with an incomparable beholding of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, not theſe we have now, but of others: alſo long laſting pleaſures of obſcenity, and other ſuch things full of luxury and folly.</q> So writeth <hi>Theophanes.</hi> But this man, who will ſeem a Chriſtian, might have learned out of the Goſpel a felicity of an higher ſtrain, one purely refined from all dregs of baſeneſſe and carnality, and that the bleſſed ſhall neither marry nor be married, but live like the Angels in Heaven, not enjoying the felicity of a ſwine, but a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall. Wherefore leaving <hi>Mahomet</hi> and other beaſts with him to enjoy ſuch a felicity as they deſerve and feigne unto themſelves; I paſſe unto our Authour's laſt folly, which is his calling it a Riddle, that the ſoul immortall is all of it in all, and again, all in every part, wondring how this ſhould be, and holding it a meer fiction and thing impoſſible. But I for my part do not wonder that a man of ſo groſſe a wit and narrow a capacity, as he in this book hath ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhould not underſtand this Doctrine or ſaying, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he will judge of the nature of indiviſible preſences by thoſe that are diviſible, as it ſeems he does. Yet I have cauſe to wonder why ſo ſtupid and ſo ſorry a fellow as this is, ſhould dare to hold it to be a Riddle, or impoſſible, onely becauſe he with his ſmall with is not able to underſtand it; as if, forſooth, nothing were poſſible to Nature, or to God the Authour of Nature, ſaving that alone which he underſtands how it can be done. I am now quite weary of this man, and ſick with raking ſo long in ſuch a heap of dirt, and therefore at this inſtant I leave him to bethink himſelf about making a timely recantation.</p>
               <p>Now, turning with delight unto my Reader, to ſolace and refreſh my ſelf after all this travaile, I deſire him to look into <hi>Hierocles</hi> Commentary upon the Golden Verſes aſcribed to <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> in which he ſeemeth to have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the original of this pernicious errour, touching the ſouls
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:114895:62"/>mortality. <q>What availes it, ſaith he, with perjuries and murders and other wicked wayes to gather wealth and to ſeem rich unto the world, and to want thoſe good things which are conducible unto the mind? But beſides, to be ſtupid and inſenſible of them, and thereby to augment the evill, or if they have any remorſe of conſcience for their offences, to be tormented in their ſouls, and affraid of the puniſhments of Hell, comforting themſelves with this alone, that there is no way of eſcaping them, and from hence are ready to cure one evill with another, &amp; by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that the ſoul is mortall, to ſooth up themſelves in wickedneſſe, judging they are not worthy to have any thing of theirs remaining after death, that ſo they might avoid thoſe puniſhments, which by judgment ſhould be inflicted on them? for a wicked man is loath to think his ſoul to be immortall, for feare of the revenges that are to follow his miſdeeds. Wherefore preventing the Judge who is below, he pronounceth the ſentence of death againſt himſelf, as holding it fit that ſuch a wicked ſoul ſhould have no longer a being nor ſubſiſtence. Behold here the fountain-head of this errour opened and purged by <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In fine, from whatſoever puddle this errour ſprung, let us remember what <hi>Socrates</hi> (being to die) delivered touching the various condition of ſouls after this life. <q>He ſaid, as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> relateth, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>Tuſcul.</hi> there were two different pathes or voyages of ſouls at their departure from the bodies: for all ſuch as with humano vices had contaminated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and were delivered wholly up to luſt, with which as with domeſtick vices being blinded, they had by lewd actions defiled themſelves, or had attempted againſt the Common-wealth any crime, or fraud inexpiable, that theſe had a wandring way aſſigned for them, ſequeſtred from the aſſemblies of the Gods; but ſuch againe as had preſerved themſelves entire and chaſte, contracting little
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114895:62"/>or no contagion from the body, having alwayes retired and withdrawn themſelves from it, and had in humane bodies imitated the converſation of the Gods, theſe found opened for them an eaſie way of returne to them from whom they proceeded at the firſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Doctrine both of <hi>Cicero</hi> and of <hi>Socrates.</hi> What then remaines to do, but to hearken attentively to the wiſe counſell of the Prince of Philoſophers, <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to have a powerfull influence into all the paſſages of our life? His words <hi>l.</hi> 10. <hi>Ethic. c.</hi> 9. according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of <hi>Andronicus Rhodius,</hi> be as follow. <q>If then, ſaith he, our underſtanding, in reſpect of man, be a thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, ſo that life which is led according unto the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, if compared with life humane, is divine alſo: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as ſome perſwade, is it lawfull for a man to reliſh and follow onely that which is humane, and being mortall, thoſe things onely which are mortall; but as much as in him lieth, he ought to vindicate himſelf from all morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and to take ſpeciall care that he live according to that part which is moſt excellent within him. Now that which is beſt within us is our mind, which though it be ſmall in bulke and weight, yet in power and excellency doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the reſt.</q> And with this wiſe counſell of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher I conclude this whole Queſtion, which though the day of every mans departure will decide, and give a ſinall reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, yet in the mean ſeaſon are not diſputes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fruitleſſe or ſuperfluous, becauſe if they be well perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they are like burning torches, which in the darke gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery of this life teach us how to direct our ſteps, and before that black day come, to help us for the making our prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before-hand, that ſo with better hopes of ſafety we may meet out deadly enemies in the gate. Without all doubting, for the repreſſing of brutiſh, beſtiall and unworthy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and again, for our encouragement to noble and generous deſignements, the beſt preparatives againſt death, there is no
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:114895:63"/>no conſideration ſo powerfull and efficacious as that one of the high perfection of mans ſoul, and the immortall nature and condition of it: for, as <hi>Cicero</hi> obſerveth <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>de legibus, Qui ſeipſum nôrit primùm aliquid ſentiet ſe habere divinum, ingeninmque in ſe ſuum ſicut ſimulacrum aliquod dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum putabit, tantóque munere Deorum ſemper aliquid di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnum faciet &amp; ſentiet.</hi> 
                  <q>He that doth know himſelf, will forthwith finde within him ſomething that is divine, and will hold his underſtanding as a ſtatue dedicated, and be alwayes thinking or doing ſomething anſwerable to ſo great munificence of the Gods.</q> That is to ſay, he will be mindfull that as in upright ſhape of body and the perfection of his ſpirit he excelleth beaſts and all creatures irrationall; ſo he will endeavour to do in the condition of his living, by diſdaining to ſtoop to any thing which is baſe, or to defile the houſe in which his foul inhabits with any unworthy or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble actions.</p>
               <p>Without all doubting there is no man who, as a Poet ſpeaketh, hath any thing within him that leaps under his left breaſt, but that if he be well perſwaded of his ſouls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and ſo, by a plain ſequel thereupon, ſees that he hath a longer part to act after his <hi>Exit</hi> from off this earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Theatre, then he hath here, he will never live unmindfull of that ſecond ſtate, and therefore will be ſure to ſtop his eares againſt the <hi>Sirens</hi> bewitching ſongs, and not drink of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting cups of <hi>Circe,</hi> whoſe fordid pleaſures are feigned to have turned <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> his unwary companions into ſwine; nor laſtly, <hi>Eſau</hi>-like, for a ſmall pittance of temporall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, or for a few voluptuous hours conſumed in vice or vanity, neglect the ſafety of his immortall ſpirit, and ſell his birth-right of Eternity.</p>
               <p>I will ſeal and ſigne this whole diſpute with the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and cenſure of the book of Wiſdome: which book whether it be received into the Canon or no, yet is it confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly very ancient, and therefore by conſent of all may claim
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114895:63"/>a juſt precedence of authority before any Heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher whatſoever: the words are theſe, <hi>Juſtorum animae in manu Deiſunt, &amp; non tanget illas tormentum mortis: viſi ſunt oculis inſipientium mori, illi autem ſunt in pace.</hi> The ſouls of the juſt be in the hands of God, and the torment of death ſhall not touch them: to the eyes of the fooliſh they ſeemed to dy but they remain in peace, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. Behold here in the judgment of this venerable Authour, what kind of people they are who hold the ſouls mortality, namely, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſuch as be deſtitute of true judgement and underſtanding. This is not my cenſure, neither is this character of my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; for who am I that I ſhould preſume ſo far? but it is the judgment of the ancient Authour of the book of Wiſdome, whoſe yeares and credit may deſerve regard, even amongſt thoſe ſpirits that be moſt confident of their own conceptions, and be the greateſt admirers and idolaters of themſelves. In fine, this ancient Sage brands all deniers of our ſouls immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality with the ſelf-ſame note of ignominy, that <hi>David</hi> the kingly prophet did mark that wretched mortall who cloſely &amp; in his heart had ſaid, <hi>There is no God. Pſa.</hi> 13. Yet there is this odds between them two, and worthy to be obſerved, for though both of them be impious and abſurd, yet one of them had ſome ſhame in him, and ſaid it onely in his heart; but this Adverſary of ours goes further, and had the face to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his impiety in Print, or at leaſt the heart to do it ſo as he himſelf might ly concealed, &amp; his name unknown. Which covert way of his, though it appear not altogether ſo bold and bad, as if he had put his name unto his work, yet was it an act too bold for any Chriſtian man or true Philoſopher to exerciſe, or to be an Authour of in Print: for alas after ſo many great Divines and deep Philoſophers, whoſe uniforme ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges we have for the dignity of man, that is to ſay, for the ſoul's immortal nature and incorruptibility how could the cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto the contrary of this poor worm be a matter any way conſiderable with men of underſtanding and ability?</p>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114895:64"/>ſimplicity and immateriality of it; as alſo by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions of them, of which the Chriſtian Hiſtories are full; and it is juſtified by <hi>Euſtratius,</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>S.

                     <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> ſaith he, alſo ſlew <hi>Julius Canus</hi> the Stoick Philoſopher, of whom the Greeks relate a fiction beyond all credit, namely, that he being led to dy, is reported to have foretold to one <hi>Antiochus,</hi> a <hi>Seleucian</hi> who followed him, with a minde undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed, that the night following he would be with him, and deal about a queſtion worth the diſcuſſing, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that <hi>Rectus,</hi> another of his fellowes, ſhould be ſlain by <hi>Caius</hi> within three dayes, all which the event proved to be true, he being ſlain within that ſpace; <hi>Antiochus</hi> relating what he had ſeen by night, and that he had beheld <hi>Canus,</hi> who had diſputed with him concerning the immortality of the ſoul, and the paſſage of it after death unto a purer light.</q> Thus <hi>Syncellus:</hi> which relation I ſee no reaſon why he ſhould hold to be a fiction. <hi>Averroës</hi> (as we uſe to call him) grants a ſoul that is ſpirituall and immortall, yet grants but one, and that one to be common unto all mankind. This phantaſie of his is generally exploded as abſurd, and convinced for ſuch by <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> in his <hi>Summe,</hi> and S. <hi>Thomas</hi> in his
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:114895:65"/>other <hi>Summe contra Gent.</hi> as alſo by divers others, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needs not to be conſidered anew. The generall Tenet of all claſſicall Philoſophers and the better ſort of Chriſtians is, that the ſoul is ſpirituall, immortall, and incorruptible, and that there be as many individualls thereof as there be men, yea and beſides, that this incorruptibility thereof is not of meer grace, and beſtowed on it after the creation, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe of nature, and involved within the principles of conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. <hi>Sennertus</hi> in his <hi>Paralip.</hi> holds it to be a perfection added to the nature merely out of favour, and in favour of his opinion cites <hi>Damaſcen. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3. but cites the greek text lamely; and <hi>Stapulenſis</hi> is miſtaken wholly in his tranſlation; for <hi>Damaſcen</hi> doth not ſay there, as they impoſe upon him, that Angels be incorruptible, not by nature but by grace, but rather the quite contrary, namely, <hi>That they by grace or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour have a nature that is immortall,</hi> for ſo the Greek Text hath it. By which words he teacheth us, that they have their nature, not by right, or of themſelves, but by grace, as all other creatures have, and their immortality from nature, as all other creatures have not: according to which account Angels are immortall by nature, that is to ſay, by a favour antecedent to their naturall being, and not ſubſequent unto it. For the better clearing of which verity, let us conſider what is properly meant or ſignified by this terme <hi>incorruptible,</hi> or <hi>immortall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I note then that of this terme there are three different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; one proper, but not ordinary; a ſecond both proper and ordinary; a third neither proper nor ordinary. Immortality in the firſt ſenſe is ſupereminent, that is to ſay, ſuch a one as hath ſo firm principles of conſtitution as be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to any agency, and therefore whatſoever is thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall can neither be diſſolved, nor annihilated. And this kinde of ſuperexcellent immortality is proper unto God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and no created entity can lay any claim unto it; and therefore 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. he is called <hi>Solus immortalis &amp;c.</hi> and of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:114895:65"/>this we are not in this place to entreat. In the ſecond ſenſe an entity is called immortall, when as the principles, though they be not proof againſt the power that can annihilate, yet are not ſubject to diſſolution or corruption, &amp; therefore being once produced are to remain ever, there being no reaſon why the cauſe that preſerves them ſhould at any time withdraw his ſovereign influence, nor any ſecond can do them harm, and ſo they are ſafe on both ſides, whatſoever <hi>Arriaga</hi> imagineth to the contrary. Immortality taken in this ſenſe is properly ſo, and this is the uſuall ſignification of the word, and again in this ſenſe it is to be underſtood, except ſome other terme or ſome circumſtance do ſhew the contrary. The third &amp; laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is when it is aſcribed to ſuch things which, although according to the naturall principles they ly expoſed to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, either by annihilation or corruption, yet are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the favour of ſome externall preſervatour. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper kind of immortality our bodies ſhould have enjoyed before the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſhall after the reſurrection; and it is rather a contingent perpetuity than any naturall immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from mortality and corruption, ſo that a body in that ſtate is ſtill <hi>corruptible,</hi> though not <hi>corrumpendum.</hi> This difference of acception of the terme being noted, I obſerve that our buſineſſe here is not to inquire in the firſt, or third ſenſe about the ſouls incorruptibility, but in the ſecond onely, as namely, whether it be incorruptible according to the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and virtue of the naturall principles of conſtitution, without recourſe to externall courteſie or favour. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion being ſtated on this ſort, it appeares thereby that we are not to diſpute point-black the ſouls immortality, but, preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to be immortall ſome way or other, whether that ſame immortality be an endowment that is naturall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pomponatius</hi> and <hi>Sennertus</hi> will not grant it to be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; and now lately one Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> in a prodigious vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of his, called by him as prodigiouſly <hi>Leviathan,</hi> is of opinion that no other immortality of the ſoul can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:114895:66"/>out of Scripture, if any at all can, beſides that one of the loweſt claſſe, which is of grace and favour merely.</p>
               <p>For eviction of the contrary both out of reaſon and Scripture, I note firſt, that the ſoul of man is an entity or ſubſtance intellectuall; and ſecondly, that every ſuch entity is capable of a true felicity, and is unquiet untill it do attain thereunto; and thirdly, that every ſuch ſublimer entity is made in a manner for it ſelf, that is to ſay, as <hi>Adam Godham</hi> judgeth, 1. <hi>Sent. q.</hi> 2. ſome way or other to enjoy its own being, and to be ſettled in a full poſſeſſion of it ſelf, reſerving alwayes the ſubordination to the ſupremeſt entity, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall dependence thereupon. This appears plainly, becauſe the whole <hi>ſpecies</hi> of man, that is to ſay, all mankinde, doth earneſtly deſire felicity &amp; the fruition of a good ſo great as may give it a full content &amp; ſatisfaction, after a ſubordinate way, for the pleaſing and rejoicing of it ſelf. In this limited ſenſe the doctrine of <hi>Eudoxus Gnidius</hi> and of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> ſubſcribed lately and explained by <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> ſeems to draw very near the truth, namely, that mans felicity did conſiſt in ſome high and refined pleaſure, not corporeal, but ſuch as is intellectuall and pure: from which opinion <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Albertus</hi> in their <hi>Ethicks</hi> ſeem not to diſſent, and <hi>Aureolus</hi> is of the ſame mind with them. In relation to this ſame contenting of our ſelves, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> deſcribes humane felicity in generall terms, without including God in any other terms then thoſe of the ſublimeſt entitie. And though in reality it be God that is our <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> and is that goodneſſe onely which can make us happy, and moreover, that we ſtand bound to love him above our ſelves, to obſerve and pleaſe him, yea, even although we were to reap no benefit thereby; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, ſuch a tranſcendent relation we have unto felicity and content, under that very title, as that abſtracting from whether there were a God or no, we ſhould as earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire to be happy and to enjoy our ſelves as we now do: and again, as we deſire to pleaſe God in all we do and ſuffer and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:114895:66"/>are, ſo alſo we do deſire felicity for the pleaſing of our ſelves, yea even independently upon any other conſideration, and ſo, although we were principally made for God, yet ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datily and ſubordinately we were made for our ſelves, and therefore for our ſelves, becauſe we were made intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall.</p>
               <p>I argue then from hence as followeth. Every entity fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the enjoying of it ſelf, and ſo for it ſelf, is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, according to the exigence of nature. But ſuch is the reaſonable ſoul, and every nature intellectuall. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the rationall ſoul and every nature intellectuall are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall according to the exigence of nature. I ſay, <hi>according to the exigence of nature,</hi> and not according to any act of grace, becauſe if we were not ſo, then had not the efficient wrought conſequently to himſelf and to his own ends. Wherefore ſeeing the skilful architect of Nature knows how to work conformably to the rules of reaſon, and to proportion his work unto the end for which he made it, it followes hence, that every rationall ſoul, or ſubſtance intellectuall, is by the order of nature made up immortall and incorruptible.</p>
               <p>And this conſequence is therefore good, becauſe it is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to felicity to be perpetuall, and to be an endleſſe ſtate of everlaſting joy, and therefore the ſubject in which this joy is to reſide cannot be otherwiſe then naturally perpetuall. Morcover, ſeeing it is our ſoul which is directly &amp; <hi>per ſc</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to felicity, and capable thereof, and our bodies onely indirectly and as it were by accident, therefore immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality belongeth primarily to the ſoul, and to the body onely by a ſequel. And ſo we argue here in conformity to that we ſhould in other caſes not unlike to this; as for example, upon a ſuppoſall made that the ſun was created to enlighten the earth perpetually, we ſhould conclude from thence that is was framed of a nature and body incorruptible.</p>
               <p>Now further, that perpetuity is of the very eſſence of felicity, or, at the leaſt, an inſeparable companion thereof,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:114895:67"/>Reaſon it ſelf doth teach us, &amp; our Divines do ſhew it plainly, as by name, <hi>Aquinas,</hi> 1. <hi>p.q.</hi> 44. <hi>a.</hi> 3. and 1.2. <hi>q.</hi> 5. <hi>a.</hi> 4. &amp; <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>cont. Gent. c.</hi> 62. <hi>Albertus, ſeu Aegidius, in compend. l.</hi> 2. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia tom.</hi> 2. <hi>d.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 6. <hi>Leſſins l.</hi> 3. <hi>de ſumm. bono c. ult. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius</hi> 4. <hi>d.</hi> 49. &amp;, as I perſwade my ſelf, <hi>Paravicinus l. de Bono,</hi> and all the reſt: foraſmuch as, of a certain, true felicity ought to be devoid of care &amp; ſorrow, &amp; then, ſeeing that which we poſſeſſe with delight, we cannot relinquiſh without ſorrow, &amp; again, what we love we cannot enjoy contentedly without our being aſſured not to loſe it, foraſmuch as the onely dread or ſuſpicion of being deprived thereof cauſes ſorrow, and is afflictive to the heart, even as well, though not as much, as the loſſe it ſelf. And for this there is great reaſon, becauſe we do not deſire alone that good which is felicity, but beſides to have it alwayes, and to be aſſured of it, and therefore we are unſatisfied and in pain unleſſe we be really happy, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all aſſured ſo to continue. Of ſo large a capacity is the ſpirit of man, as that it reſteth not in that alone which is preſent to it, but beſides, with ſwift-wing'd thoughts and flying affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions overtakes the future, and thereafter as that ſame is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended to be, good or bad, pleaſing or unpleaſant, draws from it either comfort or affliction.</p>
               <p>But why is it that a man cannot be happy for a ſeaſon, as well as miſerable for a ſeaſon? <hi>Jo. Pontius,</hi> a late Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher and follower of <hi>Scotus,</hi> is of opinion that he may; for ſo he determineth <hi>q.</hi> 6. <hi>Ethic. con.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 28. to whom I can by no means aſſent, becauſe as <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Boetius</hi> do define, Felicity is ſuch a ſtate and ſuch a good as fully ſatiates, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> repleniſhed with all that is juſtly deſirable. It is, ſaith <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, l.</hi> 3. <hi>Tuſcul. Secretis malis omnibus cumulata bonorum complexio:</hi> And <hi>Boetius, l.</hi> 3. <hi>conſol. proſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Status omnium bonorum aggregatione perfectus.</hi> Wherefore it muſt conſiſt either in all ſeverall goods together, or elſe in ſome one that conteins and countervails them all. Wherefore though a man who is miſerable now may be happy afterwards, yet
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:114895:67"/>he who is happy now can never be miſerable afterwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe happineſſe that is in being now excludes miſery both preſent and future; but, contrariwiſe, miſery that is now in being, although it excludes a preſent happineſſe, yet not a happineſſe to come. The reaſon of which diſparity is, becauſe a true and perfect happineſſe includes eſſentially, as we ſhewed before, all good things, of which number a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured perpetuity is one, as on the contrary ſide every ſtate of miſery does not of neceſſity include all evill things, or all the cauſes of infelicity, and therefore not any perpetuity of them; and for this reaſon it is that there is no repugnance why it may not have an end, foraſmuch as S. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineth, <hi>Bonum eſt ex integra cauſa, malum ex quocunque de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectu;</hi> ſeeing that more is required to the conſtitution of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity then to the deſtruction or abolition of it, more to an efficiency then to a deficiency: and ſo conſequently, although felicity cannot ſubſiſt without a perpetuity, yet infelicity may, contrarily to that which <hi>Pontius</hi> imagined. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though felicity be the ſame for a day that it is for a yeare, or for ever, conſidering only the Phyſicall entity thereof; yet conſidering the whole value and morall eſtimation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is not ſo, becauſe an endleſſe duration accruing to the poſſeſſion of any good thing doth raiſe the value of it and the juſt eſteem; as contrariwiſe, the ſame duration ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruing to an evill doth make it infinitly worſe and more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive: for which cauſe a good which is perpetual &amp; known for ſuch, may ſatiate, when being but for a time it cannot.</p>
               <p>As for brute beaſts, whatſoever M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hobbes</hi> conceives unto the contrary, they have neither ſenſe nor capacity of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent happineſſe, nor knowledge of a future. And no other in former ages, that I have heard of, beſides the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> ever aſſerted any happineſſe to beaſts; whereas, on the contrary part, according to good Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, beaſts neither have any happineſſe, nor do deſire it. <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido.</hi> No Animal, ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle l.</hi> 10.

                  <q>
                     <hi>Eth. c.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp; apnd Andronicum,</hi> 10. devoid of reaſon can be partaker of felicity, becauſe wholly deſtitute of the faculty contemplative. The life of God is happy alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and of man alſo, ſo farre forth as he reſembles him and participates of his vigorouſneſſe. No other Animal is happy, becauſe not communicating of the hability to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template. Such as be able to contemplate be capable of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and the more able to contemplate, the more happy they may be; and felicity extends it ſelf as farre as that and this, not by accident, but <hi>per ſe.</hi>
                  </q> Thus he. The true reaſon then why beaſts can have no happineſſe is, becauſe they cannot poſſeſſe nor enjoy themſelves, for want of an underſtanding ſpirit within them; and ſo properly ſpeaking, though they can <hi>be</hi> or <hi>not be,</hi> yet can they not have any thing at all, nor, contrariwiſe, loſe any thing, and ſo neither be rich nor poore, happy nor miſerable.</p>
               <p>I argue again to the ſame intent. Such as the operations of the ſoul be, ſuch is the nature of it; and therefore all the proofs for immortality drawn from the natural operations do prove the ſoul to be immortall naturally, if they prove any thing at all, as moſt wiſe Philoſophers do conceive they do.</p>
               <p>I prove the ſame out of holy Scripture againſt the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Leviathan.</hi> It is confeſt the Scripture ſaith the ſoul of man is immortall &amp; doth live after death, not adding any where that this ſame immortality is out of grace of favour; therefore, in effect, it ſayes every where, when it ſpeaks of that point, that it is immortall naturally. The Antecedent is certain by the ſurvey of thoſe ſeverall places cited by <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia,</hi> the <hi>Conimbricenſes &amp; Nic. Baius.</hi> The conſequence I prove to be a good one therefore, becauſe words are ever to be underſtood in their uſuall and proper ſignification, except ſome adjoyning words or circumſtances of the ſpeaker do imply the contrary. But in the Scripture, whereſoever it teaches the immortality of the ſoul, there is no ſuch word or circumſtance. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are to be underſtood of ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptibility
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:114895:68"/>as is naturall, becauſe that onely is the uſuall meaning of ſuch words as ſignifie an immortality: as the term <hi>man</hi> uttered without limitation ſimply, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood for a reall and naturall man, and not for a painted one or metaphoricall.</p>
               <p>To this I adde, that the verity of the ſoul's immortall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not atteſted ſingly and ſimply, but beſides as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and a verity not to be called into queſtion, even ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from thoſe Philoſophicall arguments commonly brought to prove it be demonſtrative or no; certainly their form, at leaſt, is demonſtrative, becauſe drawn <hi>ab effectis.</hi> Thus much is in ſubſtance aſſerted by <hi>Aureolus,</hi> 2. <hi>dist.</hi> 19. <q>That the ſoul, ſaith he, is immortall, is a doctrine of ſaith to be held moſt firmely, and is alſo the common conception of our underſtanding, and a verity that is evident, although it be not ſo eaſy to finde out a reaſon for it: divers of thoſe which are brought be not concluding.</q> Thus pronounceth he concerning the certainty of this doctrine, even in caſe the arguments for it ſhould not be thought convincing. And that it may be ſo, ſtands with great reaſon, becauſe we are very ſure of many naturall verities, for which, nevertheleſſe, we are not able to render any ſuch reaſon as is compelling or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative; for we do not learn all we know by the force of formall arguments or ſyllogiſmes, but rather by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual proofs, and a ſecret intelligence ſettled by nature betwixt our mindes and truth. Yet this I do not ſay as if I did not judge the reaſons for immortality to be efficacious, but only to prevent evaſions, and in particular that one of <hi>Pontius,</hi> who in the place before cited ventures to affirme that the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the ſoul is not known for a certainty by the force of naturall reaſon, therefore becauſe he holds that the arguments brought in favour of it do not convince: which aſſertion of his is not onely a diſparagement of ſo noble and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall a truth, but beſides ſeems very falſe, and gives no ſmall offenſe: becauſe, admitting the arguments for it were as not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convincing
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114895:69"/>as he himſelf pretends, yet nevertheleſſe the truth it ſelf may be very certain, even by naturall reaſon, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reolus,</hi> a very great Maſter, before hath ſignified; and if it had not been ſo, how could all nations have conſpired about it? And that they have done ſo, we may finde both by the peruſall of the Ethnick writers, as alſo by the collections of <hi>Eugubinus l.</hi> 9. <hi>de Perenni Philoſophia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Menaſſe Ben Iſrael l. de Reſurrectione c.</hi> 8. Moreover, as infirme as <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> judges the Arguments to be, yet was not he able to give them any good Solutions, although he endeavoured to do it, and beſides, did not put them home, as may be perceived by any indifferent ſurvey. The reaſons however diſparaged will be able to juſtify themſelves, and the eaſier, becauſe ſuch as do undervalue and impugne them are driven into ſuch ſtreits, as they are enforced to call in queſtion ſundry fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truths which are acknowledged generally for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and evident; as for example, That there is one Rectour of mankinde, who, according to juſtice, will reward and puniſh; ſecondly, That the generall conceptions of humane underſtanding are true; thirdly, That the univerſal appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of humane nature is rational, and alſo poſſible to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Theſe and ſuch like, although they doe not deny them to be true, yet they will not grant them to be evident. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch dangerous rocks as theſe are they driven who will not yield that the reaſons brought to prove the immortality be concluding; from which inconvenience the other ſide of claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Doctours are very ſafe and free. As for <hi>Holkot in Say. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>lect.</hi> 14. although he does not magnify thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which are uſually urged for this immortality, affirming of them that they do not preſſe more then thoſe other doe which are commonly produced againſt the poſſible eternity of the world; yet he himſelf confeſſes them to be good, though not demonſtrative, adding three arguments of his own, and alſo acknowledging that this ſame immortalitie is a doctrine delivered by the chiefeſt of the Philoſophets, maintained by
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:114895:69"/>the Catholick writers, and proved for a truth by miracles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable. Now, admitting theſe arguments to be no leſſe efficacious then thoſe other againſt the eternity, this cannot prejudice them much, becauſe many men of great learning and judgement are of opinion that theſe againſt the eternity be not onely good, but alſo demonſtrations. Moreover, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing theſe for immortality be not, in rigour, demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet all particulars being caſt up, we ſhall finde that men generally do give a conſtant aſſent to ſundry naturall verities upon leſſe evidence then theſe.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Pomponatius,</hi> we are to underſtand that he was troubled in conſcience for what he formerly had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in prejudice of immortality, and therefore, like a good Chriſtian, did not onely relinquiſh that errour of his, but beſides made ſute by a letter to <hi>Javellus,</hi> a perſon of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent learning, that he would be pleaſed to give the world which he had abuſed a ſatisfaction for him, which at his requeſt was done accordingly, as appeares by the ſaid <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellus</hi> his learned work now exant, <hi>De indeficientia animae,</hi> in which tract remaines inſerted a copie of the letter which <hi>Pomponatius</hi> wrote unto him for that end.</p>
               <p>For the compleating of this buſineſſe in hand, I note, that the Philoſophers who lived before Chriſt had much greater difficulty for their embracing this capitall Truth of immortality, then thoſe other who flouriſhed after, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that they were deſtitute of all other light then what blind Gentiliſme had left them, and therefore might not eaſily perceive but that, as it was ordinarily voiced, <hi>Mors ultima linea rerum;</hi> which ſaying was erected like the pillars of <hi>Hercules,</hi> with this ſolemn inſcription engraven upon them, <hi>Nil ultra,</hi> as if beyond thoſe there was no region habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: and beſides, it was hard to believe, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 55. <hi>Iterari vitam à morte,</hi> inſomuch as they ought to have been arguments well ſteeled that ſhould be of power ſufficient to force theirway through the brazen wall of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:114895:70"/>death, and to rear up a huge pile or fabrick of another life after corruption and rottenneſſe, of which life they could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive few or no ſignes appearing in the world. Wherefore, although the arguments for immortality were very weighty, yet they having ſuch a ſtrong barre laid to croſſe their way, no marvell if ſundry of thoſe Ancients ſhould be brought unto a ſtand, and the arguments, as forcible as they were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed, and though not killed, yet caſt into a ſlumber. For, indeed, becauſe men then knew not how to diſpoſe of ſouls after their ſeparation from the body, therefore they might have licenſe granted them to ſpeak doubtfully, not knowing what to determine, or to ſay nothing at all, either <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>contra.</hi> Some few we finde did contradict, as by name <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Lucretius:</hi> yet notwithſtanding this maine obſtacle, the generall ſenſe of the world was for the immortality, and much more then when the other hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere of life came creditably to be diſcovered by the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> for at that time thoſe old reaſons for immortality awaked, and recovered their naturall vigour and vivacity; and no wonder, becauſe this truth of immortality and that other of a life to come are mutuall inductives one unto the other, and conſpire ſo friendly, as whoſoever denies either of them, doth diſparage and weaken the other; and again, they give ſo great aides to each other, as that the notice of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other life made ready way for the entertainment of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and contrariwiſe, the doctrine of immortality added reputation to the doctrine of the other life. Moreover, The incorruptible nature of the reaſonable ſoul; The ſtate of felicity or infelicity in a life to come; That God is the high Rectour of the Univerſe, extends his providence over all, and is a juſt and bountifull rewarder; be all of them ſymbolizing verities and of a ſtrict confederacy both offenſive and defenſive, and ſo can hardly be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</p>
               <p>I conclude this ſmall labour as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Philolaus</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:114895:70"/>concluded their golden verſes, wherein the ancient doctrine is declared plainly,

I prove the minor propoſition by experience: for when the minde is troubled and out of peace and order, by reaſon of ſome loſſe or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, then all the <hi>Materia medica</hi> of <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> or of <hi>Horſtius</hi> will not make a cure: if ſo the body be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, or out of tune, no phyſicians skill will be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, we muſt not ſeek in ſuch caſes as theſe to <hi>Galen,</hi> or <hi>Celſus,</hi> or <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> or <hi>Avicenna,</hi> no druggiſts ſhop, no phyſick-garden can furniſh us with remedies againſt the raging ſorrows or bewitching pleaſures of the minde. <hi>Non eſt medicamen in hortis. Tollere nodoſum neſcit me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicina dolorem.</hi> A ſick body phyſicians can ſometimes cure, but a ſick mind never. If ſo the body be then in health, and that the infirmity do not proceed from thence, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy in that caſe muſt do the deed, and not <hi>Medicina.</hi> 
               <q>Philoſophy, ſaith <hi>Hierocles in Proem. ad aureos verſus Pythagora,</hi> is the purger of humane life, and the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: the purger it is, becauſe it delivers it from all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption contrary to reaſon, and from the mortall body; the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:114895:72"/>perfecter, becauſe by the recovery of the true naturall conſtitution, it reduceth it to a ſimilitude with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine: which two things being to be done by vertue and verity, by one of them it takes away the diſtempers of perturbations, and by the other induces a God-like form into it.</q> Thus he: conformably to whom determineth the wiſe Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus l.</hi> 2. <hi>de vita ſua</hi> §. 15. when having numbred up a world of miſeries and perplexities which haunt this life, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, ſaying, <q>What is it then that muſt conduct us through all theſe?</q> 
               <hi>Philoſophia.</hi> Alſo the great <hi>Aegyptian</hi> King <hi>Oſmanduas,</hi> as we find it recorded by <hi>Diodorus Sicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 2. raiſed a goodly ſtructure which had graven on it this inſcription, <hi>Medicatorium Animi</hi>

               </gap>, that is to ſay, a ſtore-houſe for curing of the minde; and this ſame was not an <hi>Apothecaries-ſhop,</hi> but a <hi>Library</hi> well furniſhed with books wherewith to charme mens cares, and cure both the vain delights and bitter anguiſhes of the mind, whoſe tranquillity is not procurable by medicines or receipts, but, contrariwiſe, by the good documents, for example, of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pictetus,</hi> of <hi>Seneca,</hi> or <hi>Marcus Antoninus;</hi> and where all <hi>Pagan</hi> doctrines and conſolations be deficient, by the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and good counſels to be found for us in the Holy <hi>Bible,</hi> in <hi>Thomas de Kempis, Peraldus, Petrarch de reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diis utrinſ<expan>

            <p>Now albeit the Ethnick Moraliſts can do much for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying our diſordered affections and introducing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, yet do they not come home; for though they be able to perſuade a generous contempt of all tranſitory delights and fading glories, and alſo how to draw on a kinde of ſad or diſconſolate way of reſolution for a conſtant ſuffering of all adverſities, telling us that</p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:114895:72"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Quidquid erit, ſuperanda omnis fortuna ferendo est;</hi> and read us many ſuch melancholy lectures: yet do not they aſſigne us any ſolid reaſons whereupon to build content, or whereby we might receive true ſatisfaction; but, contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, endeavour to feed us with ſhadows, as namely, by their telling us that vertue is an ample reward unto it ſelf, and again, that the miſeries and affliction of this preſent life are not evills really, though we do think them ſo, and with ſuch empty phantaſies as theſe would make us give our own experience the lie. Moreover they ſometimes ſpeak faintly and fearfully of the life to come, and the rewards thereof, by means of which alone the inequalities and the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of this can be made up and reconciled with provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. On this ſort ſpake <hi>Tacitus</hi> concerning the ſoul of his Father in law <hi>Julius Agricola</hi> then late deceaſed: <hi>Si quis piorum manibus locus ſit, ſi, ut Sapientibus placet, non cum corporibus extinguuntur magnae animae, placidè quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcas,</hi> 
               <q>If, ſaith he, to the ſpirits of the pious there be any place remaining; if, as wiſe men are perſuaded, great ſouls be not extinguiſhed with their bodies, mayeſt thou ſweetly reſt.</q> To ſtrong and preſſing ſorrows ſuch feeble reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies did many of the Ethnicks bring; but this ſovereign medicine was left for Chriſtianity to compoſe and ſhew unto the world, by the belief of which thoſe cold ſweats with which many before had been ſore afflicted, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented wholly.</p>
            <p>Another naturall track whereby to trace out immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is the univerſall ſhamefaſtneſſe of mankinde of the own nakedneſſe; which paſſion is not found to be in brute beaſts; and the reaſon of the difference between them ſeems to be, becauſe beaſts are corruptible, and are ſo to be, but men, though now they alſo be corruptible, yet it ſeems they were not ſo to be, but onely by a miſadventure or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance: for mans body, becauſe compoſed of ſeverall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing parcells, is diſſolvable, and may be taken in ſunder
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:114895:73"/>by the very ſame way that it was put together, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the own right cannot lay any juſt claim to a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity more then other compoſed bodies can, yet it ſeems that by right of the being matched with a ſubſtance intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall it might pretend unto it, and therefore holds it a diſparagement and diſgrace to be reputed mortall, which without ſuch a title it could not do: and ſeeing nakedneſſe betrayes it to be a piece of corruption, a condition ſo abject and inferiour, it is aſhamed to be ſeen, foraſmuch as ſexes be the evident marks and tokens of mortality; for why are ſexes, but to propagate? and what need of propagation, but onely to provide a ſubſtitute? and none provides a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour or a ſubſtitute, who is not himſelf to be turned out and to be gone: of which mean and inferiour condition, as not befitting, men are aſhamed, and in relation to this grand imperfection, we finde that men labour to conceale, even as much and as long as poſſible, their amorous affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as ſpringing out of a root of corruption. Thus we ſee that men once in high fortunes, and caſt down and grown into neceſſity, are abaſhed at their poor and preſent ſtate, whenas others that were poor and low alwayes be not ſo. And this I conceive to be the principal reaſon why men doe bluſh at buſineſſes of corporeall love, and are aſhamed of their nakedneſſe, although hitherto I do not know any that in particular have taken notice of it.</p>
            <p>Now finally, how immortality is conſiſtent with the principles of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and alſo how it doth follow upon them, is not my intention to examine, as being a long and intricate piece of work, and performed by others, as namely by <hi>Javellus l. de indeficientia anima,</hi> and of late by <hi>Card. Auguſtinus Oregius</hi> in a work peculiarly intended for that purpoſe.</p>
